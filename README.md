# DistractionBuster
A machine learning project to detect distraction when browsing websites at work.
We pick 10 catagories from wikipedia that are very distant from each other.
We gather articles in those 10 catagories as training set and preserve some of those
articles as our test data. 

For performance tuning we randomly select articles from different catagories and blablabla.
