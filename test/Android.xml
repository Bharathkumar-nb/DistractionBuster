'''Android''' is a [[mobile operating system]] developed by [[Google]], based on the [[Linux kernel]] and designed primarily for [[touchscreen]] mobile devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer|tablets]]. Android's [[user interface]] is mainly based on [[Direct manipulation interface|direct manipulation]], using touch gestures that loosely correspond to real-world actions, such as swiping, tapping and pinching, to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a [[virtual keyboard]] for text input. In addition to touchscreen devices, Google has further developed [[Android TV]] for televisions, [[Android Auto]] for cars, and [[Android Wear]] for wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on [[Laptop|notebooks]], [[Video game console|game consoles]], [[digital camera]]s, and other electronics.

Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, along with the founding of the [[Open Handset Alliance]]{{snd}}a consortium of [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing [[open standard]]s for mobile devices. Beginning with the [[HTC Dream|first commercial Android device]] in September 2008, the operating system has gone through multiple major releases, with the current version being [[Android Nougat|7.0 &quot;Nougat&quot;]], released in August 2016. Android applications (&quot;[[Mobile app|apps]]&quot;) can be downloaded from the [[Google Play]] store, which features over 2.7&amp;nbsp;million apps as of February 2017. Android has been the best-selling OS on tablets since 2013, and runs on the vast majority{{efn|70%+}} of smartphones. In September 2015, Android had 1.4&amp;nbsp;billion monthly active users, and it has the largest [[installed base]] of any operating system.

Android's [[source code]] is released by Google under an [[open source license]], although most Android devices ultimately ship with a combination of [[Free and open source software|free and open source]] and [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] software, including proprietary software required for accessing Google services. Android is popular with technology companies that require a ready-made, low-cost and customizable operating system for [[high-tech]] devices. Its open nature has encouraged a large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as a foundation for community-driven projects, which deliver updates to older devices, add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. The success of Android has made security an issue, in which the majority of Android devices do not receive [[Patch (computing)|security patches]], and it has become a target for patent and copyright litigation as part of the so-called &quot;[[Smartphone patent wars|smartphone wars]]&quot; between technology companies.

On November 5, 2007, the [[Open Handset Alliance]], a [[consortium]] of technology companies including Google, device manufacturers such as [[HTC]], [[Motorola Mobility|Motorola]] and [[Samsung]], wireless carriers such as [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]], and chipset makers such as [[Qualcomm]] and [[Texas Instruments]], unveiled itself, with a goal to develop &quot;the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Announcement of OHA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Industry Leaders Announce Open Platform for Mobile Devices |url=http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/press_110507.html |website=[[Open Handset Alliance]] |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Erick |last=Schonfeld |title=Breaking: Google Announces Android and Open Handset Alliance |url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/11/05/breaking-google-announces-android-and-open-handset-alliance/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Rubin |title=Where's my Gphone? |url=https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2007/11/wheres-my-gphone.html |website=Official Google Blog |publisher=[[Google]] |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the [[HTC Dream]], also known as T-Mobile G1, announced on September 23, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Doug |last=Aamoth |title=T-Mobile officially announces the G1 Android phone |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/09/23/t-mobile-officially-announces-the-g1-android-phone/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 23, 2008 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard |last=Gao |title=Android and its first purchasable product, the T-Mobile G1, celebrate their 8th birthdays today |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/09/23/android-first-purchasable-product-t-mobile-g1-celebrate-8th-birthdays-today/ |website=Android Police |date=September 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Android has seen [[Android version history|numerous updates]] which have incrementally improved the operating system, adding new features and fixing [[Software bug|bugs]] in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after a dessert or sugary treat, with the first few Android versions being called &quot;[[Cupcake]]&quot;, &quot;[[Donut]]&quot;, &quot;[[Eclair]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Frozen yogurt|Froyo]]&quot;, respectively. During its announcement of [[Android KitKat]] in 2013, Google explained that &quot;Since these devices make our lives so sweet, each Android version is named after a dessert&quot;, although a Google spokesperson told [[CNN]] in an interview that &quot;It’s kind of like an internal team thing, and we prefer to be a little bit — how should I say — a bit inscrutable in the matter, I’ll say&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murali K. |last=Menon |title=Android Nougat: Here’s why Google names the OS after sweets |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/from-donut-to-nougat-why-are-android-versions-named-after-sweets-2887237/ |website=[[The Indian Express]] |publisher=[[Indian Express Limited]] |date=July 3, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interface ===
Android's default user interface is mainly based on [[Direct manipulation interface|direct manipulation]], using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, along with a [[virtual keyboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Touch Devices |url=http://source.android.com/tech/input/touch-devices.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120125061950/http://source.android.com/tech/input/touch-devices.html |website=Android Open Source Project |publisher=[[Google]] |archivedate=January 25, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Game controller]]s and full-size physical [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]] are supported via [[Bluetooth]] or [[USB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Handling Controller Actions |url=https://developer.android.com/training/game-controllers/controller-input.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Handling Keyboard Input |url=https://developer.android.com/training/keyboard-input/index.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interface, often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide [[Haptic technology|haptic feedback]] to the user. Internal hardware, such as [[accelerometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s and [[proximity sensor]]s are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions, for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sensors Overview |url=https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a [[racing game]] by rotating the device, simulating control of a [[steering wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Chavez |title=Real Racing 2 Speeds Into The Android Market - Leaves Part 1 In The Dust |url=http://phandroid.com/2011/12/22/real-racing-2-speeds-into-the-android-market-leaves-part-1-in-the-dust/ |website=Phandroid |date=December 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android devices boot to the homescreen, the primary navigation and information &quot;hub&quot; on Android devices, analogous to the [[Desktop metaphor|desktop]] found on personal computers. Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and [[Software widget|widgets]]; app icons launch the associated app, whereas widgets display live, auto-updating content, such as a [[weather forecast]], the user's email inbox, or a [[news ticker]] directly on the homescreen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Widgets |url=https://developer.android.com/design/patterns/widgets.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A homescreen may be made up of several pages, between which the user can swipe back and forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design info&quot;/&gt; Third-party apps available on [[Google Play]] and other app stores can extensively re-[[Theme (computing)|theme]] the homescreen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Hindy |title=15 best Android launcher apps of 2017 |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/best-android-launcher-apps-222408/ |website=Android Authority |date=February 4, 2017 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even mimic the look of other operating systems, such as [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Whitson |last=Gordon |title=Launcher 7 Brings Windows Phone's Simple, Attractive Interface to Android |url=http://lifehacker.com/5804091/launcher-7-brings-windows-phones-simple-attractive-interface-to-android |website=[[Lifehacker]] |publisher=[[Univision Communications]] |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel A. |last=Begun |title=Looking at the Android operating system |url=http://www.dummies.com/consumer-electronics/smartphones/droid/looking-at-the-android-operating-system/ |website=[[For Dummies]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the top of the screen is a status bar, showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be &quot;pulled&quot; down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Phones &amp; Tablets |url=https://developer.android.com/design/handhelds/index.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notifications are &quot;short, timely, and relevant information about your app when it’s not in use&quot;, and when tapped, users are directed to a screen inside the app relating to the notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notifications |url=https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/notifications.html |website=Material Design |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.1 &quot;Jelly Bean&quot;]], &quot;expandable notifications&quot; allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notifications |url=http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/notifications.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121208022602/http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/notifications.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |archivedate=December 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An All Apps screen lists all installed applications, with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen. A Recents screen lets users switch between recently used apps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Design info&quot;/&gt;

=== Applications ===
{{See also|Android software development|Google Play}}
Applications (&quot;[[Mobile app|apps]]&quot;), which extend the functionality of devices, are written using the [[Android software development]] kit (SDK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alex |last=Mullis |title=How to install the Android SDK (Software Development Kit) |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/how-to-install-android-sdk-software-development-kit-21137/ |website=Android Authority |date=November 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, often, the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to Android |url=https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Java may be combined with [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Android NDK Native APIs |url=https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/stable_apis.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with a choice of non-default [[Runtime library|runtimes]] that allow better C++ support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=C++ Library Support |url=https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cpp-support.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Go (programming language)|Go]] programming language is also supported, although with a limited set of [[application programming interface]]s (API).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=package app |url=https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/mobile/app |website=GoDoc |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDK includes a comprehensive set of development tools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/index.html |title = Tools Overview |work = Android Developers |date = July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a [[debugger]], [[Software library|software libraries]], a handset [[emulator]] based on [[QEMU]], documentation, sample code, and tutorials. Initially, Google's supported [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) was [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] using the Android Development Tools (ADT) plugin; in December 2014, Google released [[Android Studio]], based on [[IntelliJ IDEA]], as its primary IDE for Android application development. Other development tools are available, including a [[native development kit]] (NDK) for applications or extensions in C or C++, [[Google App Inventor]], a visual environment for novice programmers, and various [[Multiple phone web based application framework|cross platform mobile web applications frameworks]].

Android has a growing selection of third-party applications, which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application's [[APK (file format)|APK]] (Android application package) file, or by downloading them using an [[application store]] program that allows users to [[package manager|install, update, and remove applications]] from their devices. [[Google Play Store]] is the primary application store installed on Android devices that comply with Google's compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-irongrip&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=Google’s iron grip on Android: Controlling open source by any means necessary |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=October 21, 2013 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;geek-poweredby&quot; /&gt;  Google Play Store allows users to browse, download and update applications published by Google and third-party developers; {{As of|lc=y|2013|7}}, there are more than one million applications available for Android in Play Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2013/07/24/google-play-1-million/ |title=Google Play Hits 1 Million Apps |date=July 24, 2013 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |work=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2013|7}}, 50 billion applications have been installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Play Hits 1 Million Apps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warren|first1=Christina|title=Google Play Hits 1 Million Apps|url=http://mashable.com/2013/07/24/google-play-1-million/|publisher=Mashable|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;android-compatibility&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Due to the open nature of Android, a number of third-party application marketplaces also exist for Android, either to provide a substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store, provide applications that cannot be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations, or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the [[Amazon Appstore]], [[GetJar]], and SlideMe. [[F-Droid]], another alternative marketplace, seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under [[free and open source]] [[Free software license|licenses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-irongrip&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wired_alt_app_stores&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/06/independent-app-stores-take-on-googles-android-market/ |title=Independent App Stores Take On Google's Android Market |date=June 11, 2010 |first=Priya |last=Ganapati |work=[[Wired News]] |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=The great Ars experiment—free and open source software on a smartphone?! |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/exploring-the-world-of-foss-android-can-a-smartphone-be-open-source/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=July 29, 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lee |last=Hutchinson |title=Google evicts ad-blocking software from Google Play store |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/google-evicts-ad-blocking-software-from-google-play-store/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=March 14, 2013 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory management ===
Since Android devices are usually battery-powered, Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at a minimum. When an application is not in use the system [[Process state|suspends its operation]] so that, while available for immediate use rather than closed, it does not use battery power or CPU resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;phonedogtask&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonedog.com/2011/06/26/the-truth-about-android-task-killers-and-why-you-don-t-need-them/ |title=The truth about Android task killers and why you don't need them |publisher=PhoneDog |date=June 26, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grail.cba.csuohio.edu/~matos/notes/cis-493/lecture-notes/Android-Chapter03-Life-Cycle.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222153131/http://grail.cba.csuohio.edu/~matos/notes/cis-493/lecture-notes/Android-Chapter03-Life-Cycle.pdf |title=Lesson 3: Android Application's Life Cycle |date=September 9, 2013 |accessdate=April 15, 2014 |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |author=Victor Matos |publisher=Cleveland State University |work=grail.cba.csuohio.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically: when memory is low, the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes, starting with those that have been inactive for longest.&lt;ref name=&quot;phandroidtask&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phandroid.com/2011/06/16/android-psa-stop-using-task-killer-apps-now/ |title=Android PSA: Stop Using Task Killer Apps |publisher=Phandroid.com |date=June 16, 2011 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3hAdK1IBkYC&amp;pg=PT53 |title=Professional Android 4 Application Development |author=Reto Meier |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task killers were doing more harm than good.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifehackertask&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5862994/real-world-test-show-that-android-task-killers-are-still-useless |title=Updates |publisher=Lifehacker.com |date=|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main hardware platform for Android is the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] ([[ARMv7]] and [[ARMv8-A]] architectures), with [[x86]], [[MIPS instruction set|MIPS and MIPS64]], and [[x86-64]] architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android.&lt;ref name=&quot;Android Lollipop platform support&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Android Lollipop |url=https://developer.android.com/about/versions/lollipop.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Support for 64-bit x86 |url=https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/x86-64.html |website=Android Developers |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mark |last=LaPedus |title=Update: MIPS gets sweet with Honeycomb |url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1259370 |website=[[EE Times]] |publisher=AspenCore Media |date=April 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unofficial [[Android-x86]] project provided support for the x86 architectures ahead of the official support.&lt;ref name=&quot;ARMAN-4.0-on-x86&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9222323/Google_s_Android_4.0_ported_to_x86_processors |title=Google's Android 4.0 ported to x86 processors |last=Shah |first=Agam |date=December 1, 2011 |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://01.org/android-ia/ |title=Android on Intel Architecture |publisher=01.org |date=July 11, 2013 |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; MIPS architecture was also supported before Google did. Since 2012, Android devices with [[Intel]] processors began to appear, including phones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/mobile-phone-reviews/9314362/Orange-San-Diego-Intel-Android-mobile-phone-review.html |title=Orange San Diego Intel Android mobile phone review |last1=Warman |first1=Matt |date=June 7, 2012 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited |accessdate=June 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms, Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on [[ARM64]]. Since Android&amp;nbsp;5.0 &quot;Lollipop&quot;, [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] variants of all platforms are supported in addition to the [[32-bit]] variants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Android Lollipop platform support&quot;/&gt;

Requirements for the minimum amount of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] for devices running Android&amp;nbsp;5.1 range from 512&amp;nbsp;[[MiB|MB]] of RAM for normal-density screens, to about 1.8&amp;nbsp;GB for high-density screens.&lt;ref&gt;http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//compatibility/android-cdd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation for Android&amp;nbsp;4.4 is to have at least 512&amp;nbsp;MB of RAM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Android KitKat |url=http://developer.android.com/about/versions/kitkat.html |work=Android Developers Portal |accessdate=November 16, 2013 |publisher=android.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for &quot;low RAM&quot; devices 340&amp;nbsp;MB is the required minimum amount that does not include memory dedicated to various hardware components such as the [[baseband processor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Android Compatibility Definition Document |publisher=Google |publication-date=November 27, 2013 |edition=4.4 |format=PDF |page=33 |section=7.6.1 |url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en/us/compatibility/android-cdd.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Android 4.4 requires a [[32-bit]] [[ARMv7]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] or [[x86]] architecture processor (latter two through unofficial ports),&lt;ref name=&quot;ARMAN-4.0-on-x86&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://01.org/android-ia/ |title=Android on Intel Architecture |publisher=01.org |date=July 11, 2013 |accessdate=February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with an [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0 compatible [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU).&lt;ref name=&quot;android-opengl-2.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://source.android.com/devices/graphics.html
 | title = Android Developers: Graphics

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Android supports OpenGL ES 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 and as of latest major version, 3.2 and [[Vulkan (API)|Vulkan]]. Some applications may explicitly require a certain version of the OpenGL ES, and suitable GPU hardware is required to run such applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;android-opengl-2.0&quot; /&gt;

Android devices incorporate many optional hardware components, including still or video cameras, [[GPS]], [[Orientation sensing|orientation sensors]], dedicated gaming controls, [[accelerometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s, barometers, [[magnetometer]]s, [[proximity sensor]]s, [[pressure sensor]]s, thermometers, and [[touchscreen]]s. Some hardware components are not required, but became standard in certain classes of devices, such as smartphones, and additional requirements apply if they are present. Some other hardware was initially required, but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example, as Android was developed initially as a phone OS, hardware such as microphones were required, while over time the phone function became optional.&lt;ref name=&quot;android-compatibility&quot; /&gt; Android used to require an [[autofocus]] camera, which was relaxed to a [[Fixed-focus lens|fixed-focus]] camera&lt;ref name=&quot;android-compatibility&quot; /&gt; if present at all, since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android started to be used on [[set-top box]]es.

In addition to running on smartphones and tablets, several vendors run Android natively on regular PC hardware with a keyboard and mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/product/1427121/n308.html|title=Lenovo N308 Desktop specs|work=PCWorld|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jide.com/remixos|title=Remix OS - The Future of Android PC is now on Android Marshmallow|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2152540/android-on-the-big-screen-we-chew-up-and-spit-out-three-jelly-bean-all-in-one-pcs.html|title=Three Android all-in-one PCs reviewed|author=Michael Brown|date=May 8, 2014|work=PCWorld|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techspot.com/review/805-acer-ta272-hul-android-aio/|title=Acer TA272 HUL Android All-in-One Review|author=Shawn Knight|work=TechSpot|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their availability on commercially available hardware, similar PC hardware-friendly versions of Android are freely available from the Android-x86 project, including customized Android&amp;nbsp;4.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.android-x86.org/releases/releasenote-4-4-r1|title=ReleaseNote 4.4-r1 – Android-x86 – Porting Android to x86|publisher=|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the Android [[emulator]] that is part of the [[Android SDK]], or by using [[BlueStacks]] or Andy, Android can also run non-natively on x86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogeek.com/179691/4-ways-to-run-android-on-your-pc-and-make-your-own-dual-os-system/ |title=4 Ways to Run Android on Your PC and Make Your Own &quot;Dual OS&quot; System |publisher=Howtogeek.com |date=January 13, 2014 |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brad Chacos |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2048220/hybrid-hijinks-how-to-install-android-on-your-pc.html |title=Hybrid hijinks: How to install Android on your PC |publisher=PCWorld |date=September 6, 2013 |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese companies are building a PC and mobile operating system, based on Android, to &quot;compete directly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/08/25/technology/security/china-os/|title=China ditching Windows and Android for its own operating system|author=Jose Pagliery|date=August 25, 2014|work=CNNMoney|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese Academy of Engineering noted that &quot;more than a dozen&quot; companies were customising Android following a Chinese ban on the use of Windows 8 on government PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28928369|title=BBC News – China plans new PC operating system in October|work=BBC News|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324539404578342132324098420?mg=reno64-wsj|title=China Criticizes Android's Dominance|author=Paul Mozur|date=March 5, 2013|work=WSJ|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/24/us-china-technology-idUSKBN0GO08H20140824|title=China targets own operating system to take on likes of Microsoft, Google|work=Reuters|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the green Android logo was designed for Google by graphic designer [[Irina Blok]]. The design team was tasked with a project to create a universally identifiable icon with the specific inclusion of a robot in the final design. After numerous design developments based on [[science fiction]] and space movies, the team eventually sought inspiration from the human symbol on restroom doors and modified the figure into a robot shape. As Android is open-source, it was agreed that the logo should be likewise, and since its launch the green logo has been reinterpreted into countless variations on the original design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Pagan |last=Kennedy |title=Who Made That Android Logo? |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/magazine/who-made-that-android-logo.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Google began decoupling certain aspects of the operating system (particularly its core applications) so they could be updated through the [[Google Play]] store independently of the OS. One of those components, [[Google Play Services]], is a [[closed-source]] system-level process providing [[API]]s for Google services, installed automatically on nearly all devices running [[Android Froyo|Android 2.2 &quot;Froyo&quot;]] and higher. With these changes, Google can add new system functionality through Play Services and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=Balky carriers and slow OEMs step aside: Google is defragging Android |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/09/balky-carriers-and-slow-oems-step-aside-google-is-defragging-android/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=September 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.2 and 4.3 &quot;Jelly Bean&quot;]] contained relatively fewer user-facing changes, focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=Review: Android 4.3’s multitude of minor changes future-proofs the platform |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/review-android-4-3-future-proofs-the-platform-with-multitude-of-minor-changes/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=August 9, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Bloomberg]]'' reported that Google was making efforts to keep Android more up-to-date, including accelerated rates of security updates, rolling out technological workarounds, reducing requirements for phone testing, and ranking phone makers in an attempt to &quot;shame&quot; them into better behavior. As stated by ''Bloomberg'': &quot;As smartphones get more capable, complex and hackable, having the latest software work closely with the hardware is increasingly important&quot;. Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Android lead, admitted that &quot;It’s not an ideal situation&quot;, further commenting that the lack of updates is &quot;the weakest link on security on Android&quot;. Wireless carriers were described in the report as the &quot;most challenging discussions&quot;, due to carriers' slow approval time due to testing on their networks, despite some carriers, including [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]] and [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]], having already shortened their respective approval times. [[HTC]]'s then-executive Jason Mackenzie called monthly security updates &quot;unrealistic&quot; in 2015, and Google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches from the full testing procedures. In a further effort for persuasion, Google shared a list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its Android partners, and is considering making the list public. Mike Chan, co-founder of phone maker Nextbit and former Android developer, said that &quot;The best way to solve this problem is a massive re-architecture of the operating system&quot;, &quot;or Google could invest in training manufacturers and carriers &quot;to be good Android citizens&quot;&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jack |last1=Clark |first2=Scott |last2=Moritz |title=Google Steps Up Pressure on Partners Tardy in Updating Android |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-25/google-steps-up-pressure-on-partners-tardy-in-updating-android |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=May 25, 2016 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=Google’s making a list: Android OEMs to be ranked, shamed by update speed |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/05/google-hopes-to-shame-slow-android-oems-with-update-rankings/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=May 26, 2016 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Abner |last=Li |title=Report: Google pressuring OEMs and carriers to speed up Android updates, security patches |url=https://9to5google.com/2016/05/25/android-security-os-updates/ |website=9to5Google |date=May 25, 2016 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software stack ===
[[File:Android-System-Architecture.svg|thumb|right|350px|Android's architecture diagram]]On top of the Linux kernel, there are the [[middleware]], [[software library|libraries]] and [[Application programming interface|APIs]] written in [[C (programming language)|C]], and [[application software]] running on an [[application framework]] which includes [[Oracle Java|Java]]-compatible libraries.  Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of other Android's source code bases.

Until version 5.0, Android used [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] as a [[process virtual machine]] with [[Tracing just-in-time compilation|trace-based just-in-time (JIT) compilation]] to run Dalvik &quot;dex-code&quot; (Dalvik Executable), which is usually translated from the [[Java bytecode]].  Following the trace-based JIT principle, in addition to [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreting]] the majority of application code, Dalvik performs the compilation and [[Machine code|native execution]] of select frequently executed code segments (&quot;traces&quot;) each time an application is launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For its Java library, the Android platform uses a subset of the now discontinued [[Apache Harmony]] project.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-njdk&quot;/&gt; In December 2015, Google announced that the next version of Android would switch to a Java implementation based on [[OpenJDK]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vb-openjdk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Google confirms next Android version won’t implement Oracle’s proprietary Java APIs|url=http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/29/google-confirms-next-android-version-wont-use-oracles-proprietary-java-apis/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android's [[C standard library|standard C library]], [[Bionic (software)|Bionic]], was developed by Google specifically for Android, as a derivation of the [[BSD]]'s standard C library code.  Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel.  The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the [[GNU C Library]] (glibc) or [[uClibc]] are its smaller runtime footprint, and optimization for low-frequency CPUs.  At the same time, Bionic is licensed under the terms of the [[BSD licence]], which Google finds more suitable for the Android's overall licensing model.&lt;ref name=&quot;brady_dissects_android&quot; /&gt;

Aiming for a different licensing model, toward the end of 2012, Google switched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed [[BlueZ]] to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/597293/ |title=Returning BlueZ to Android |date=May 6, 2014 |publisher=[[LWN.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android does not have a native [[X Window System]] by default, nor does it support the full set of standard [[GNU]] libraries.  This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android,&lt;ref name=&quot;APIs&quot; /&gt; until version r5 of the [[Android Native Development Kit]] brought support for applications written completely in [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since Marshmallow, &quot;[[Toybox]]&quot;, a collection of command line utilities (mostly for use by apps, as Android doesn't provide a [[command line interface]] by default), replaced similar &quot;Toolbox&quot; collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;toyboxmarsmallow&quot;&gt;[https://lwn.net/Articles/629362/ Android gets a toybox] on [[lwn.net]] by Jake Edge (January 14, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

Android has another operating system, Trusty OS, within it, as a part of &quot;Trusty&quot; &quot;software components supporting a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on mobile devices.&quot; &quot;Trusty and the Trusty API are subject to change. [..] Applications for the Trusty OS can be written in C/C++ (C++ support is limited), and they have access to a small C library. [..] All Trusty applications are single-threaded; multithreading in Trusty userspace currently is unsupported. [..] Third-party application development is not supported in&quot; the current version, and software running on the OS and processor for it, run the &quot;[[Digital rights management|DRM]] framework for protected content. [..] There are many other uses for a TEE such as mobile payments, secure banking, full-disk encryption, multi-factor authentication, device reset protection, replay-protected persistent storage, wireless display (&quot;cast&quot;) of protected content, secure PIN and fingerprint processing, and even malware detection.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://source.android.com/security/trusty/index.html |title=Trusty TEE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|AOSP}}Open-source community ===
Android has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the ''Android Open Source Project'' (AOSP) source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Damien |last=McFerran |title=Best custom ROMs for the Samsung Galaxy S2 |url=http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/mobile-apps/best-custom-roms-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s2-50007658 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120419194709/http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/mobile-apps/best-custom-roms-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s2-50007658 |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=April 17, 2012 |archivedate=April 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels, with a comparable level of quality;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Artem |last=Russakovskii |title=Custom ROMs For Android Explained - Here Is Why You Want Them |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2010/05/01/custom-roms-for-android-explained-and-why-you-want-them/ |website=Android Police |date=May 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates; or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems, such as the [[HP TouchPad]].

There have also been attempts with varying degrees of success to port Android to iPhones, notably the iDroid Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idroidproject.org/|title=Main Page|work=idroidproject.org|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party [[firmware]] development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this.&lt;ref name=&quot;htcdev&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://htcdev.com/bootloader |title=HTC's bootloader unlock page |publisher=Htcdev.com |date=|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, modified firmwares such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features, such as [[tethering]], for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium. As a result, technical obstacles including locked [[bootloader]]s and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices. However, as community-developed software has grown more popular, and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the &quot;[[iOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]]&quot; of mobile devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sadun |first=Erica |url=http://www.tuaw.com/2010/07/26/library-of-congress-rules-in-favor-of-jailbreaking/ |title=LoC rules in favor of jailbreaking |publisher=Tuaw.com |date=July 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development, with some, including [[HTC]],&lt;ref name=&quot;htcdev&quot; /&gt; [[Motorola]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/24/motorola-offers-unlocked-bootloader-tool-for-droid-razr-verizon-removes-it/ |title=Motorola Offers Unlocked Bootloader Tool |publisher=Techcrunch.com |first=Jordan |last=Crook |date=October 24, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samsung]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspiredgeek.com/2011/06/08/cyanogenmod-7-for-samsung-galaxy-s2-ii-development-already-started/ |title=CyanogenMod 7 for Samsung Galaxy S2 (II): Development Already Started! |date=June 8, 2011 |work=Inspired Geek}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Menno |title=CyanogenMod coming to the Galaxy S 2, thanks to Samsung |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/cyanogenmod-coming-galaxy-sii-thanks-samsung |website=Android Central |publisher=Mobile Nations |date=June 6, 2011 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sony Mobile Communications|Sony]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forian |first=Daniel |url=http://developer.sonyericsson.com/wp/2011/09/28/sony-ericsson-supports-independent-developers/ |title=Sony Ericsson supports independent developers – Developer World |publisher=Developer.sonyericsson.com |date=|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing support and encouraging development. As a result of this, over time the need to circumvent [[hardware restrictions]] to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable [[bootloader]]s, similar to [[Google Nexus|Nexus]] series of phones, although usually requiring that users waive their devices' warranties to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;htcdev&quot; /&gt; However, despite manufacturer acceptance, some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down, frustrating developers and customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Kopstein |title=Access Denied: why Android’s broken promise of unlocked bootloaders needs to be fixed |url=http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/20/3666668/access-denied-android-unlocked-bootloaders |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope of surveillance by public institutions ===
As part of the broader [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures]] it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies, the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ), respectively, have access to the user data on iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android devices. They are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information, including SMS, location, emails, and notes.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiegel20130907&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-920971.html|title=Privacy Scandal: NSA Can Spy on Smart Phone Data|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=September 7, 2013|author=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, further reports revealed the intelligence agencies' capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as [[Angry Birds]], which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons. GCHQ has, according to ''[[The Guardian]]'', a [[wiki]]-style guide of different apps and advertising networks, and the different data that can be siphoned from each.&lt;ref name=&quot;angrybirdsatgchq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/nsa-gchq-smartphone-app-angry-birds-personal-data|title=Angry Birds and 'leaky' phone apps targeted by NSA and GCHQ for user data &amp;#124; World news|date=|publisher=theguardian.com|author=James Ball|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week, the Finnish Angry Birds developer [[Rovio Entertainment|Rovio]] announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations, and called upon the wider industry to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/28/angry-birds-rovio-respond-nsa-spying-revelations|title=Angry Birds firm calls for industry to respond to NSA spying revelations &amp;#124; World news|date=January 28, 2014|publisher=theguardian.com|author=James Ball|accessdate=February 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents revealed a further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk.&lt;ref name=&quot;angrybirdsatgchq&quot; /&gt; The NSA and GCHQ insist their activities are in compliance with all relevant domestic and international laws, although the Guardian stated &quot;the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information, especially for those outside the US, who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;angrybirdsatgchq&quot; /&gt;

=== Common security threats ===
Research from security company [[Trend Micro]] lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware, where text messages are sent from infected phones to [[premium-rate telephone number]]s without the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device, or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Emil |last=Protalinski |title=Android malware numbers explode to 25,000 in June 2012 |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-malware-numbers-explode-to-25000-in-june-2012/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=July 17, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially; however, Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being [[Fear, uncertainty and doubt|exaggerated]] by security companies for commercial reasons,&lt;ref name=&quot;exaggeration&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3320818/mobile-malware-exaggerated-by-charlatan-vendors-says-google-engineer/|title=Mobile malware exaggerated by &quot;charlatan&quot; vendors, says Google engineer|date=November 24, 2011|publisher=PC Advisor|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;extremely&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Jerry |last=Hildenbrand |title=Android 4.2 brings new security features to scan sideloaded apps |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/android-42-brings-new-security-features-scan-sideloaded-apps |website=Android Central |publisher=Mobile Nations |date=November 2, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users.&lt;ref name=&quot;exaggeration&quot; /&gt; Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare,&lt;ref name=&quot;extremely&quot; /&gt; and a survey conducted by [[F-Secure]] showed that only 0.5% of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Android-malware-perspective-only-0.5-comes-from-the-Play-Store_id36696|title=Android malware perspective: only 0.5% comes from the Play Store|date=|publisher=Phonearena.com|accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android's [[Platform fragmentation|fragmentation]] is a problem for security, since patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodbye, Android&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/goodbye-android|title=Goodbye, Android|website=Motherboard|publisher=Vice|last1=Franceschi-Bicchierai|first1=Lorenzo|accessdate=August 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adrian |last=Kingsley-Hughes |title=The Android 'toxic hellstew' survival guide |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/the-android-toxic-hellstew-survival-guide/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 9, 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One set of researchers say that the failure of vendors to support older devices with patches and updates leaves more than 87% of active devices vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Liam |last=Tung |title=Android security a 'market for lemons' that leaves 87 percent vulnerable |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-security-a-market-for-lemons-that-leaves-87-percent-insecure/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 13, 2015 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~drt24/papers/spsm-scoring.pdf|title=Security Metrics for the Android Ecosystem|last2=Beresford|first2=Alastair R.|publisher=[[Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge]]|doi=10.1145/2808117.2808118|last3=Rice|first3=Andrew|first1=Daniel R.|last1=Thomas|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the open-source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses. For example, Samsung has worked with General Dynamics through their [[Open Kernel Labs]] acquisition to rebuild ''Jelly Bean'' on top of their hardened microvisor for the &quot;Knox&quot; project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/02/28/general_dynamics/|title=Air-to-ground rocket men flog top-secret mobe-crypto to Brad in accounts|date=February 28, 2013|publisher=The Register|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/technology/samsung-armors-android-to-take-on-blackberry.html|title=Samsung Armors Android to Take On BlackBerry|date=February 28, 2013|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of [[Wi-Fi]] access points, encountered as phone users move around, to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones, allowing them to run apps like [[Foursquare]], [[Google Latitude]], [[Facebook Places]], and to deliver location-based ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/09/technology/09google.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Skyhook%20Wireless%20v.%20Google%20Case%20Yields%20E-Mail%20Insight&amp;st=cse|title=Suit Opens a Window Into Google|date=May 8, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|author=Steve Lohr|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appanalysis.org/faq.html|title=AppAnalysis.org: Real Time Privacy Monitoring on Smartphones|accessdate=February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; an academic research-funded project, can, in some cases, detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/09/data-collection-android/|title=Study Shows Some Android Apps Leak User Data Without Clear Notifications &amp;#124; Gadget Lab|last=Ganapati|first=Priya|date=September 30, 2010|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technical security features ===
Android applications run in a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]], an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system's resources, unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gary |last=Sims |title=How secure is Android? |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/secure-android-90523/ |website=Android Authority |date=May 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, a &quot;Verify Apps&quot; feature scans apps for malicious behavior. Originally only doing so during installation, Verify Apps received an update in 2014 to &quot;constantly&quot; scan apps, and in 2017 the feature was made visible to users through a menu in Settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Whitwam |title=Google's Verify Apps now shows apps that it has recently scanned |url=http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/13/googles-verify-apps-now-shows-apps-recently-scanned/ |website=Android Police |date=February 13, 2017 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Kyle |last=Wiggers |title=Google's virus-scanning Verify Apps feature for Android now reveals its secrets |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/verify-apps-list-update/ |website=[[Digital Trends]] |date=February 15, 2017 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before installing an application, the [[Google Play]] store displays a list of the requirements an app needs to function. After reviewing these permissions, the user can choose to accept or refuse them, installing the application only if they accept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review app permissions thru Android 5.9 |url=https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6014972 |website=Google Play Help |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Android Marshmallow|Android 6.0 &quot;Marshmallow&quot;]], the permissions system was changed; apps are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time. An opt-in system is used instead, in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions to an app when they are needed for the first time. Applications remember the grants, which can be revoked by the user at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Mediati |title=How to toggle app permissions in Android Marshmallow |url=http://www.greenbot.com/article/2990078/android/how-to-toggle-app-permissions-in-android-marshmallow.html |website=Greenbot |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Seifert |title=Google announces Android M, available later this year |url=http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8675257/android-m-os-update-google-io-2015 |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=May 28, 2015 |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new permissions model is used only by applications developed for Marshmallow using its [[software development kit]] (SDK), and older apps will continue to use the previous all-or-nothing approach. Permissions can still be revoked for those apps, though this might prevent them from working properly, and a warning is displayed to that effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Hoffman |title=How to Manage App Permissions on Android 6.0 |url=https://www.howtogeek.com/230683/how-to-manage-app-permissions-on-android-6.0/ |publisher=How-To Geek |date=October 11, 2015 |accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ara |last=Wagoner |title=How to take advantage of the new App Permissions in Marshmallow |url=http://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-advantage-new-app-permissions-marshmallow |website=Android Central |publisher=Mobile Nations |date=November 1, 2015 |accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google publishes most of the code (including network and telephony [[solution stack|stacks]]) under the [[non-copyleft]] [[Apache License]] version 2.0. which allows modification and redistribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Mobile-and-Wireless/Google-Open-Sources-Android-on-Eve-of-G1-Launch/ |work=[[eWeek]] |title=Google Open-Sources Android on Eve of G1 Launch |first=Clint |last=Boulton |date=October 21, 2008 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Paul |title=Why Google chose the Apache Software License over GPLv2 for Android |url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2007/11/why-google-chose-the-apache-software-license-over-gplv2/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The license does not grant rights to the &quot;Android&quot; trademark, so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the [[copyleft]] [[GNU General Public License]] version 2, developed by the [[Open Handset Alliance]], with the source code publicly available at all times. Typically, Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device (part of the Nexus series) featuring the new version of Android, then makes the source code available after that device has been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/faqs.html#what-is-involved-in-releasing-the-source-code-for-a-new-android-version |title=Frequently Asked Questions: What is involved in releasing the source code for a new Android version? |work=Android Open Source Project |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 ''Honeycomb'' release.

Only the base Android operating system (including some applications) is open-source software, whereas most Android devices ship with a substantial amount of proprietary software, such as [[Google Mobile Services]], which includes applications such as [[Google Play Store]], Google Search, and [[Google Play Services]]{{snd}} a software layer that provides [[Application programming interface|APIs]] for the integration with Google-provided services, among others. These applications must be licensed from Google by device makers, and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;geek-poweredby&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Google mandates ‘Powered by Android’ branding on new devices|url=http://www.geek.com/android/google-mandates-powered-by-android-branding-on-new-devices-1589253/|work=Geek.com|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Custom, certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers (such as [[TouchWiz]] and [[HTC Sense]]) may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-irongrip&quot; /&gt; There may also be &quot;[[binary blob]]&quot; [[Driver (software)|drivers]] required for certain hardware components in the device.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-irongrip&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Building for devices&quot; /&gt;

Some stock applications in AOSP code that were formerly used by earlier versions of Android, such as Search, Music, and Calendar, have been [[deprecation|abandoned]] by Google in favor of [[proprietary software|non-free]] replacements distributed through Play Store (Google Search, Google Play Music, and Google Calendar) that are no longer open-source. Moreover, open-source variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their non-free versions, such as Photosphere panoramas in Camera, and a [[Google Now]] page on the default home screen (exclusive to the proprietary version &quot;Google Now Launcher&quot;, whose code is embedded within that of the main Google application).&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-irongrip&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=“Google Now Launcher” hits Play Store, brings Google homescreen to GPE &amp; Nexus devices |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/02/google-now-launcher-hits-play-store-brings-google-homescreen-to-gpe-nexus-devices/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Richard Stallman]] and the [[Free Software Foundation]] have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as [[Replicant (operating system)|Replicant]], because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary, and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or deinstall applications and, as a result, invite non-free software. although the Free Software Foundation has not found Google to use it for malicious reasons &lt;ref name=&quot;stallman2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/sep/19/android-free-software-stallman|publisher=The Guardian |title=Is Android really free software? |first=Richard |last=Stallman |date=September 19, 2011|accessdate=September 9, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/android-and-users-freedom.html|title=Android and Users' Freedom – Support the Free Your Android campaign|first=Richard|last=Stallman |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |work=GNU.org |date=August 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leverage over manufacturers ===
Google licenses their Google Mobile Services software, along with Android trademarks, only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google's compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document.&lt;ref name=AndroidCompatibility&gt;{{cite book |title=Android Compatibility Definition Document |publisher=Google |publication-date=January 11, 2015 |edition=5.0 |format=PDF |access-date=March 3, 2015 |url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en/us/compatibility/android-cdd.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google's non-free components, stay incompatible with applications that require them, and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-irongrip&quot; /&gt; Examples of such Android forks are [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Fire OS]] (which is used on the [[Kindle Fire]] line of tablets, and oriented toward Amazon services), the [[Nokia X Software Platform]] (a fork used by the [[Nokia X family]], oriented primarily toward [[Nokia]] and [[Microsoft]] services), and other forks that exclude Google apps due to the general unavailability of Google services in certain regions (such as [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Warren |title=This is Nokia X: Android and Windows Phone collide |url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/24/5440498/nokia-x-android-phone-hands-on |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Liau Yun |last=Qing |title=Phonemakers make Android China-friendly |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/phonemakers-make-android-china-friendly/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=October 15, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Google also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google Mobile Services software display a prominent &quot;Powered by Android&quot; logo on their boot screens.&lt;ref name=&quot;geek-poweredby&quot; /&gt;

Android received a lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007. Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance, it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7080758.stm |title=Technology &amp;#124; Q&amp;A: Google's Android |publisher=BBC News |date=November 6, 2007 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of an open-source, Linux-based [[Computing platform|development platform]] sparked interest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Marguerite |last=Reardon |title=Google Android prototypes debut at MWC |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/google-android-prototypes-debut-at-mwc/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=February 11, 2008 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market, such as Nokia and Microsoft, and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/androids-outing-at-barcelona/2008/02/12/1202760277773.html?page=2 |title=Android's outing at Barcelona – BizTech – Technology |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These established players were skeptical: [[Nokia]] was quoted as saying &quot;we don't see this as a threat,&quot; and a member of Microsoft's Windows Mobile team stated &quot;I don't understand the impact that they are going to have.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Miller |title=Symbian, Nokia, Microsoft and Apple downplay Android relevance |url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/11/05/symbian-nokia-microsoft-and-apple-downplay-android-relevance/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=November 5, 2007 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Android's popularity, including an activation rate three times that of iOS, there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adrianne |last=Jeffries |title=Disconnect: why Andy Rubin and Android called it quits |url=http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/19/4120208/why-andy-rubin-android-called-it-quits |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Verge]]'' suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services{{snd}} Amazon's Kindle Fire line uses [[Fire OS]], a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google's proprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its competing [[Amazon Appstore]] instead of Play Store.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-irongrip&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- Google SVP [[Andy Rubin]], who was replaced as head of the Android division in March 2013, has been blamed for failing to establish a lucrative partnership with cell phone makers.

For example, according to data from [[OpenSignal]] in July 2013, there were 11,868 models of Android device, numerous different screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use, while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianfrag&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Arthur|first=Charles|title=Android fragmentation 'worse than ever' – but OpenSignal says that's good|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/30/android-fragmentation-visualised-opensignal|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=August 1, 2013|date=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as [[Apple Insider]] have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed Android's growth through large volumes of low end, budget-priced devices running older versions of Android. They maintain this forces Android developers to write for the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; to reach as many users as possible, who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on a smaller percentage of devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eran |first=Daniel |url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/16/strong-demand-of-apples-iphone-5-series-driving-an-anti-fragmentation-of-ios |title=Strong demand of Apple's iPhone 5 series driving an &quot;anti-fragmentation&quot; of iOS |publisher=Appleinsider.com |date=October 16, 2013 |accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, OpenSignal, who develops both Android and iOS apps, concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier, Android's wider global reach also increases the potential reward.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianfrag&quot; /&gt;

Despite its success on smartphones, initially Android tablet adoption was slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilson Rothman |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/why-ipad-stomping-android-tabs-24-1-121875 |title=Why iPad is stomping Android tabs 24 to 1 – Technology on |publisher=Nbcnews.com |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main causes was the [[chicken or the egg]] situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to a lack of high quality tablet applications, but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was a significant market for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin C.

Despite app support in its infancy, a considerable number of Android tablets (alongside those using other operating systems, such as the [[HP TouchPad]] and [[BlackBerry PlayBook]]) were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad.&lt;ref name=&quot;tabs&quot; /&gt; ''InfoWorld'' has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as a &quot;Frankenphone business&quot;, a short-term low-investment opportunity by placing a smartphone-optimized Android OS (before Android 3.0 ''Honeycomb'' for tablets was available) on a device while neglecting user interface. This approach, such as with the [[Dell Streak]], failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of Android tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gruman |first=Galen |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/mobile-technology/googles-tighter-control-over-android-good-thing-845 |title=Why Google's tighter control over Android is a good thing &amp;#124; Mobile Technology |publisher=InfoWorld |date=April 5, 2011 |accessdate=March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gruman |first=Galen |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1159578/anatomy_of_failure_rim_microsoft_nokia.html |title=Anatomy of failure: Mobile flops from RIM, Microsoft, and Nokia |publisher=Macworld |date=|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, several Android tablets such as the [[Motorola Xoom]] were priced the same or higher than the [[iPad]], which hurt sales. An exception was the [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] [[Kindle Fire]], which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon's ecosystem of applications and content.&lt;ref name=&quot;tabs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hiner |first=Jason |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/hiner/why-android-tablets-failed-a-postmortem/10011 |title=Why Android tablets failed: A postmortem |publisher=TechRepublic |date=January 5, 2012 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This began to change in 2012, with the release of the affordable [[Nexus 7 (2012 version)|Nexus&amp;nbsp;7]] and a push by Google for developers to write better tablet applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=Google to Android devs: make nicer tablet apps, pretty please? |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/google-to-android-devs-make-nicer-tablet-apps-pretty-please/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=October 8, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to International Data Corporation, shipments of Android-powered tablets surpassed iPads in Q3 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kovach|first=Steve|title=Android Now Ahead Of Apple's iOS In Tablet Market Share|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/android-ahead-of-ios-tablet-market-share-2013-5|publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the end of 2013, over 191.6 million Android tablets had sold in three years since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2674215|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Tablet Sales Grew 68 Percent in 2013, With Android Capturing 62 Percent of the Market|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1980115|title=Gartner Says Worldwide Media Tablets Sales to Reach 119 Million Units in 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made Android tablets the most-sold type of tablet in 2013, surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.abiresearch.com/press/android-ecosystem-takes-the-baton-from-apple-ipad- |title=Android Ecosystem Takes the Baton from Apple iPad in the Tablet Race |publisher=ABIresearch |date=September 27, 2013 |accessdate=September 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Galen Gruman of ''[[InfoWorld]]'' stated that Android devices could be a &quot;real part of your business [..] there's no longer a reason to keep Android at arm's length.

=== Application piracy ===
In general, paid Android applications can easily be [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated]].&lt;ref name=&quot;piracy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Wired UK |url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/05/wired-uk-android-game-piracy/ |title=Op-Ed: Android Piracy Is Huge Problem for Game Devs &amp;#124; Game&amp;#124;Life |publisher=Wired.com |date=May 3, 2012 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 2012 interview with [[Eurogamer]], the developers of [[Football Manager]] stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yin |first=Wesley |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-04-24-football-manager-dev-hopes-to-stick-with-android-despite-9-1-piracy-rate |title=Football Manager dev hopes to stick with Android despite 9:1 piracy rate|publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue; for example, in July 2012 the developers of the game [[Wind-up Knight]] said that piracy levels of their game were only 12%, and most of the piracy came from China, where people cannot purchase apps from Google Play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Armasu |first=Lucian |url=http://www.androidauthority.com/piracy-rates-are-higher-ios-android-wind-up-knight-developer-104305/ |title=Wind-up Kinght developer: Piracy rates on iOS and Android are comparable, China is the main source|publisher=Androidauthority.com |date=July 30, 2012 |accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Google released a tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps, but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to [[Software cracking|crack]].

{{further information|Oracle v. Google|Smartphone wars|Patent troll}}

Both Android and Android phone manufacturers have been involved in numerous patent lawsuits. On August 12, 2010, [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9180678/Update_Oracle_sues_Google_over_Java_use_in_Android |title=Update: Oracle sues Google over Java use in Android |first=James |last=Niccolai |date=August 12, 2010 |work=Computerworld |publisher=IDG |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/18/us-oracle-google-lawsuit-idUSTRE75H0FP20110618|title=Oracle seeks up to $6.1 billion in Google lawsuit|publisher=Reuters|date=June 18, 2011|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this valuation was rejected by a United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_18532705|title=Judge tosses Oracle's $6.1 billion damage estimate in claim against Google|publisher=MercuryNews.com|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Google submitted multiple lines of defense, counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle's patents or copyright, that Oracle's patents were invalid, and several other defenses. They said that Android's Java runtime environment is based on [[Apache Harmony]], a [[clean room design|clean room]] implementation of the Java class libraries, and an independently developed virtual machine called [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/10/google-oracle-android/ |title=Calling Oracle Hypocritical, Google Denies Patent Infringement |first=Ryan |last=Singel |date=October 5, 2010 |work=Wired |accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Lowensohn |title=Jury clears Google of infringing on Oracle patents |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/jury-clears-google-of-infringing-on-oracle-patents/ |website=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=May 23, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Mullin |title=Google wins crucial API ruling, Oracle’s case decimated |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/google-wins-crucial-api-ruling-oracles-case-decimated/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=May 31, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parties agreed to zero dollars in [[statutory damages]] for a small amount of copied code.&lt;ref name=&quot;damages&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In December 2015, Google announced that the next major release of Android ([[Android Nougat]]) would switch to [[OpenJDK]], which is the official open-source implementation of the Java platform, instead of using the now-discontinued Apache Harmony project as its runtime. Code reflecting this change was also posted to the AOSP source repository.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-njdk&quot;/&gt; In its announcement, Google claimed this was part of an effort to create a &quot;common code base&quot; between Java on Android and other platforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;vb-openjdk&quot; /&gt; Google later admitted in a court filing that this was part of an effort to address the disputes with Oracle, as its use of OpenJDK code is governed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) with a [[GPL linking exception|linking exception]], and that &quot;any damages claim associated with the new versions expressly licensed by Oracle under OpenJDK would require a separate analysis of damages from earlier releases&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ars-njdk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Ron |last=Amadeo |title=Android N switches to OpenJDK, Google tells Oracle it is protected by the GPL |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/android-n-switches-to-openjdk-google-tells-oracle-it-is-protected-by-the-gpl/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=January 6, 2012 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, a United States federal court ruled in favor of Google, stating that its use of the APIs was fair use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Mullin |title=Google beats Oracle—Android makes “fair use” of Java APIs |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/05/google-wins-trial-against-oracle-as-jury-finds-android-is-fair-use/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=May 26, 2016 |accessdate=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to lawsuits against Google directly, various [[proxy war]]s have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices, with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Jared |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/240783/microsoftsamsung_patent_deal_great_news_for_windows_phones.html |title=Microsoft-Samsung Patent Deal: Great News for Windows Phones |publisher=PCWorld |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement, with Apple's ongoing [[Apple Inc. v.

In 2013, [[FairSearch]], a lobbying organization supported by Microsoft, Oracle and others, filed a complaint regarding Android with the [[European Commission]], alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive [[predatory pricing]].
