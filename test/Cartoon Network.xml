'''Cartoon Network''' is an American [[cable television|basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[cable channel|channel]] that is owned by [[Time Warner]] through the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] subsidiary. It was founded by [[Betty Cohen]] and launched on October 1, 1992. 

The channel primarily broadcasts children's shows, mostly [[animation|animated]] programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It is primarily aimed at children and young teenagers between the ages of 7 to 15, and targets older teens and adults with mature content during its [[late night television|late night]] [[Dayparting|daypart]] [[Adult Swim]], which is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a separate channel by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] for [[Audience measurement|ratings]] purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;as_split&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6516.html|title=Adult Swim/CN Split Cements Strategy|date=March 3, 2005|work=ICv2|publisher=GCO|accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates daily from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM (ET). A [[Spanish language]] audio track for select programs is accessible via [[second audio program]]ing (SAP); some cable and satellite companies offer the Spanish feed as a separate channel. It is also the related channel of Turner-owned [[Boomerang (channel)|Boomerang]].

As of January 2016, Cartoon Network is available to approximately 94.0 million pay television households (80.7% of households with television) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: January 2016|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|date=January 31, 2016|accessdate=November 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===1986–92: Development===
On August 4, 1986, [[Ted Turner]]'s Turner Broadcasting System acquired [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]/[[United Artists]] from [[Kirk Kerkorian]]; due to concerns over the debt load of his companies, on October 17, 1986, Turner was forced to sell MGM back to Kerkorian after approximately only 74 days of ownership. However, Turner kept much of MGM's film and television library made prior to May 1986 (as well as some of the United Artists library) and formed [[Turner Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://articles.latimes.com/1986-03-04/business/fi-15193_1_ted-turner|title=Way Cleared for Turner's MGM Deal| first= Al| last= Delugach| date=March 4, 1986|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]| accessdate= 2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 1988, its cable channel [[TNT (TV channel)|Turner Network Television]] was launched and had gained an audience with its extensive film library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-23/entertainment/ca-744_1_ted-turner-s-cable|title=Ted Turner's TNT Exploding Onto the Cable Scene|first=Jane|last=Hall|date=January 23, 1990|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Turner's animation library included the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM cartoon]] library, the pre-1948 color ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' shorts, the [[Harman-Ising]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' shorts (except ''[[Lady, Play Your Mandolin!]]''), and the [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Famous Studios]] ''[[Popeye]]'' cartoons.

In 1991, Turner Entertainment purchased animation studio [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] for US $320 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turner Buying Hanna-Barbera|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/30/business/company-news-turner-buying-hanna-barbera.html|date=October 30, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992–2001: Cohen era===

On February 18, 1992, Turner Broadcasting System announced its plans to launch the Cartoon Network as an outlet for Turner's considerable library of animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;launch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/business/the-media-business-turner-broadcasting-plans-to-start-a-cartoon-channel.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Turner Broadcasting Plans To Start a Cartoon Channel|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=February 19, 1992|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1992, Cartoon Network played &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; (which was a tradition whenever a new Turner-owned network launched) and a video of a person placing a dynamite in a field and then blowing the dynamite up, the channel's launch then occurred on that day and was hosted by the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] cartoon character [[Droopy]] in a special event called ''Droopy's Guide to the Cartoon Network'', during which the first cartoon on the network, ''[[The Great Piggy Bank Robbery]]'', was shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-10-04/entertainment/25997256_1_betty-cohen-new-channels-cartoon-network|title=That's All Cartoons, Folks&amp;nbsp;– 24 Hours Daily|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=October 4, 1992|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=[[Philadelphia Media Network]]|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Network Sold Out to Toon of First 3 Months|date=September 11, 1992|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fifth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CR0QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=posDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6652%2C195222|title=Turner's 5th: The Cartoon Network|first=Jeffry|last=Scott|date=October 1, 1992|work=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vanpartible.com/cn-20|title=CN TWENTY|first=Van|last=Partible|date=October 1, 2012|work=VanPartible.com|accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial programming on the channel consisted exclusively of reruns of classic Warner Bros. cartoons (the pre-1948 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), the 1933–1957 ''Popeye'' cartoons, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] cartoons, and [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons.&lt;ref name=&quot;launch&quot;/&gt; At first, cable providers in [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington D.C.]], and [[Detroit]] carried the channel.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifth&quot;/&gt; By the time the network launched, Cartoon Network had an 8,500-hour cartoon library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=229iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3nYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1307,57411&amp;dq=cartoon+network&amp;hl=en|title=Cartoon Network off to a slow start|date=October 1, 1992|work=Observer-Reporter|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its launch until 1995, the network's announcers said the network's name with the word &quot;The&quot; added before &quot;Cartoon Network&quot;, thus calling the network &quot;The Cartoon Network&quot;. By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TNT, entitled &quot;Cartoon Network on TNT&quot;.

Cartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre&quot;&gt;Mittell (2004), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&amp;nbsp;– ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer air on a regular basis, with the exception of ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]''.

A challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become &quot;the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre&quot;/&gt;

For the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be simulcast on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'' and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.

The network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces To Life|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of &quot;recycled animation cells&quot; from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed &quot;minimal&quot;. The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its &quot;[[Hip (slang)|hip]]&quot; perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre4&quot;&gt;Mittell (2004), p. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] parody. This was arguably the first time the network revived a &quot;classic animated icon&quot; in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the &quot;new ironic and self-referential context&quot; for them. Promotional shorts such as the &quot;Scooby-Doo Project&quot;, a parody of the ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time2&quot;&gt;Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time3&quot;&gt;Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the &quot;classic days&quot; of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' and ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seibert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/fred-seibert-interview-part-1|title=The Fred Seibert Interview&amp;nbsp;– Part 1|first=Joe|last=Strike|date=July 15, 2003|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoon Network was able to assess the potential of certain shorts to serve as pilots for spin-off series and signed contracts with their creators to create ongoing series.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre4&quot;/&gt; ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' was the most popular short series according to a vote held in 1995 and eventually became the first [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''What a Cartoon!'' in 1996. Three more series based on shorts debuted from 1997 to 1999: ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' (the latter two as segments of the same show; ''I Am Weasel'' was later spun off into a separate show), ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', and ''[[Mike, Lu &amp; Og]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seibert&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mike, Lu And Og&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/95956-Mike_Lu_And_Og.html|title=Mike, Lu And Og (1996)&amp;nbsp;– What A Cartoon! Show Cartoon Episode Guide|work=[[Big Cartoon DataBase]]|accessdate=2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unrelated series ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'' was also launched in 1999, creating a line-up of critically acclaimed shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genre&quot;/&gt; Many of these series premiered bearing the &quot;Cartoon Cartoons&quot; brand, airing throughout the network's schedule and prominently on Cartoon Cartoon Fridays, which became the marquee night for premieres of new episodes and series beginning on June 11, 1999.

These original series were intended to appeal to a wider audience than the average [[Saturday morning cartoon]]. [[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less &quot;[[bawdy]]&quot; than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less &quot;[[socially responsible]]&quot; than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output, each individual series managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time2&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.

In 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom]], in 1977). The merger consolidated ownership of all the Warner Bros. cartoons, allowing the post-July 1948 and the former [[Sunset Productions|Sunset]]-owned black-and-white cartoons (which Warner Bros. had reacquired in the 1960s) releases to be shown on the network. Although most of the post-July 1948 cartoons were still contracted to be shown on Nickelodeon and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the network would not air them until September 1999 (from Nickelodeon) and October 2000 (from ABC), however, the majority of the post-July 1948 cartoons that were shown on its now-sibling broadcast network [[The WB Television Network|The WB]]'s [[Kids' WB]] block began airing on Cartoon Network in January 1997. Newer animated productions by Warner Bros.' animation subsidiary also started appearing on the network&amp;nbsp;– mostly reruns of shows that had aired on Kids' WB and some from [[Fox Kids]], along with certain new programs such as ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,253466,00.html|title=Equal 'Justice'?|first=John|last=Sellers|date=November 16, 2001|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartoon Network's programming would not be available in Canada until 1997 when a Canadian [[specialty channel]] called [[Teletoon]] and its [[Télétoon|French-language counterpart]] launched.

In 1997, Cartoon Network launched a new action block entitled [[Toonami]]. Its lineup consisted of action cartoons and anime, such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!]]'', ''[[Gundam Wing]]'', and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. Toonami was hosted by Moltar from the ''Space Ghost'' franchise until 1999, where Toonami was later hosted by its own original character, a muscular teenage robot named TOM. During that same year, a series of bumpers featuring the instrumental [[Powerhouse (instrumental)|Powerhouse]] were introduced. These bumpers lasted from 1997 to 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldmark|first1=Daniel|last2=Taylor|first2=Yuval|title=The Cartoon Music Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5rfRdOMfTqsC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=powerhouse+%2B+%22Cartoon+network%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6Ncm5V6pYq&amp;sig=AKm_SFAcVcoXDWs9A0MvRvXF0Yo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLwKbFmbHSAhVC5CYKHXyrBzY4FBDoAQgqMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=powerhouse%20%2B%20%22Cartoon%20network%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 27, 2017|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=January 1, 2002|page=159|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One new original series premiered in 2000: ''[[Sheep in the Big City]]''. On April 1, Cartoon Network launched a [[digital cable]] and satellite channel known as [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]], which was spun off from one of their programming blocks that featured retro animated series and shorts.

===2001–07: Samples era===
Three new original series premiered in 2001: ''[[Time Squad]]'', ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', and ''[[Grim &amp; Evil]]''. On June 18, [[Betty Cohen]], who had served as Cartoon Network's president since its founding, left due to creative disagreements with [[Jamie Kellner]], then-head of [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]]. On August 22, Jim Samples was appointed general manager and Executive Vice President of the network, replacing Cohen. [[Adult Swim]] debuted on September 2, with an episode of ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]''; the block initially aired on Sunday nights, with a repeat telecast on Thursdays. The initial lineup consisted of ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]'', ''[[Sealab 2021]]'', ''[[The Brak Show]]'', ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', and ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]''.

In 2002, ''[[Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?]]'' and ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' premiered; the former was short-lived, but the latter became a juggernaut for the network in the mid-2000s. The first theatrical film based on a Cartoon Network series, ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'', was released on July 3, 2002. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $16.4 million globally on a budget of $11 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=powerpuffgirls.htm|title=The Powerpuff Girls Movie (2002) - Box Office Mojo|work=boxofficemojo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1 of that year, Cartoon Network celebrated their tenth anniversary, with a montage showcasing the network's various phases over the years.

2003 saw the debuts of ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy]]'' and ''[[Evil Con Carne]]'', both spinoffs of ''Grim &amp; Evil''. On October 3, the Cartoon Cartoon Fridays block was rebooted in a live-action format as &quot;Fridays&quot;, hosted by Tommy Snider and Nzinga Blake (2003–2004), the latter of which was later replaced by Tara Sands (2005–2007). It aired several new Cartoon Network series, most of which did not bear the &quot;Cartoon Cartoon&quot; sub-brand.

[[File:Cartoon Network 2004 logo.svg|thumb|Cartoon Network's second logo, used in various forms and styles from June 14, 2004, to May 28, 2010.]]
In 2004, Cartoon Network premiered three new original series: ''[[Megas XLR]]'', ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', and ''[[Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi]]''. On June 14, Cartoon Network debuted an updated version of its original logo (with the checkerboard motif retained and the &quot;C&quot; and &quot;N&quot; being the centerpiece) and a new slogan, &quot;This is Cartoon Network!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2004/06/Cartoon_Network_Launches_New_OnAir_Reface_Supplemental_06-28-2004| title= Cartoon Network Launches New On-air Re-face and Supplemental Logo to Kick Off Summer|date=June 28, 2004|publisher=[[Time Warner]]| accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] introduced as part of the rebrand featured [[traditional animation|2D]] cartoon characters from its shows interacting in a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] city composed of sets from their shows. By now, nearly all of Cartoon Network's classic programming had been relocated to its sister network [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] to make way for new programming.

2005 saw the debuts of four more original series: ''[[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', and ''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]''. On August 22, Cartoon Network launched a block aimed at the preschool demographic known as ''Tickle U''; shows on the block included ''[[Gordon the Garden Gnome]]'', ''[[Harry and His Bucket Full of Dinosaurs]]'', ''[[Peppa Pig]]'', ''[[Firehouse Tales]]'', and ''[[Gerald McBoing-Boing (TV series)|Gerald McBoing-Boing]]''. The block was largely unsuccessful and was discontinued in 2007.

After its predecessor, ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', Cartoon Network created an all-new animated short series consisting of overseas shorts, pilots, college shorts, or even shorts created for the show itself. That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig &quot;Sven&quot; Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1–3 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.

Two new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''. Three made-for-TV movies debuted this year: ''[[List of Codename: Kids Next Door episodes|Codename: Kids Next Door&amp;nbsp;– Operation Z.E.R.O.]]'', ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends: Good Wilt Hunting]]'', and ''[[Re-Animated]]'', the latter of which was the network's first live-action TV movie and a collaboration between live-action and animation. By this point, most of the network's older Cartoon Cartoons (such as ''Dexter's Laboratory'' and ''The Powerpuff Girls'') could be viewed in segments on a half-hour block known as ''The Cartoon Cartoon Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-fall-of-cartoon-network/|title=The Fall of Cartoon Network|work=themarysue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–14: Snyder era===
Samples resigned from his post on February 9, 2007, following a [[2007 Boston Mooninite panic|bomb scare in Boston]] caused by packages left around the city that were part of an outdoor marketing campaign promoting the Adult Swim series ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two held after ad campaign triggers Boston bomb scare|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/|date=February 1, 2007|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jim Samples&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/newsmakers/cartoon_network/|title=Cartoon Network Boss Quits Over Bomb Scare|date=February 9, 2007 |publisher= CNN |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 2, Stuart Snyder was named Samples' successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/110859-Stuart_Snyder_The_Perfect_Combination.php|title=Stuart Snyder: The Perfect Combination |first= Allison| last= Romano|date= October 21, 2007|publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 1, the network's look was revamped, with bumpers and station IDs themed to [[The Hives]] song &quot;[[The Hives#The Hives on Cartoon Network|Fall is Just Something That Grown-Ups Invented]].&quot; 2007 saw the debut of ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'', a spin-off of the movie ''Re-Animated'', and the first live-action Cartoon Network series. 2007 also saw the debut of the series ''[[Chowder (TV series) |Chowder]]''. In late 2007, The network began broadcasting programs from [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] channels such as [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] and [[Teletoon]], including ''[[George of the Jungle (2007 TV series)|George of the Jungle]]'', ''[[6teen]]'', ''[[Storm Hawks]]'', ''[[League of Super Evil]]'', ''[[Chaotic (TV series)|Chaotic]]'', ''[[Bakugan Battle Brawlers]]'', ''[[Stoked (TV series)|Stoked]]'', and the ''[[Total Drama]]'' series. Each October from 2007 to 2009, Cartoon Network also re-ran 40 episodes of the former [[Fox Kids]] series ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]''.

Cartoon Network announced at its 2008 upfront that it was working on a new project called ''[[The Cartoonstitute]]'', which was headed by animators [[Craig McCracken]] as executive producer and [[Rob Renzetti]] as supervising producer. Both reported to [[Rob Sorcher]], who created the idea. It would have worked similar to ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'', by creating at least 150 pieces of animation within 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/cartoon-network-upfront-presentation-announcements| title= Cartoon Network Upfront Presentation Announcements|first=Annemarie|last=Moody|date=April 3, 2008| publisher= Animation World Network| accessdate= 2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cartoonstitute'' was eventually cancelled,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} and out of all the shorts, two or three, ''[[Regular Show]]'', ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' and ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'', were selected, after animator Craig McCracken (creator of ''The Powerpuff Girls'' and ''Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends'') left the network after 15 years in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} On September 20, 2008, Cartoon Network ended Toonami after its 11-year run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-09-20/cartoon-network-to-reportedly-end-toonami-tonight|title=Cartoon Network to End Toonami on September 20|date=September 20, 2008|publisher=Anime News Network |accessdate= 2011-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2008, Cartoon Network began airing animated shorts that served as interstitials between programs, called ''Wedgies'', which included ''The Talented Mr. Bixby'', ''Nacho Bear'', ''Big Baby'' and ''The Bremen Avenue Experience''. The Wedgies shorts ran from 2008 to 2009, with a second run in 2010; the shorts were discontinued afterward, although [[rerun]]s can still be seen on [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]] as of March 2013. On June 5, 2008, the network took on a refreshed look created by Tristan Eaton and was animated by [[Crew972]]. The bumpers of that era had white, faceless characters called Noods, based on the DIY toy, [[Munny]]. The standard network logo was then completely white, adopting different colors based on the occasion in the same style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motionographer.com/2009/01/13/capacity-cartoon-network-rebrand/| title= Capacity: Cartoon Network Rebrand|first=Justin|last=Cone|date=January 13, 2009|work=Motionographer|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Cartoon Network introduced a block of live-action reality shows called &quot;CN Real&quot;, featuring programs such as ''[[The Othersiders]]'', ''[[Survive This]]'', ''[[BrainRush]]'', ''[[Destroy Build Destroy]]'', ''[[Dude, What Would Happen]]'' and ''[[Bobb'e Says]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CN Real&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/17/entertainment/et-cartoon-reality17| title= Cartoon Network's new reality shows, kid style|first=Robert|last=Lloyd|date=June 17, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate= 2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network also aired some limited sports programming, including basketball recaps and [[Slamball]] games, during commercial breaks. That year, it also started airing live-action feature films from [[Warner Bros.]] and [[New Line Cinema]].

[[File:Cartoon Network extended logo 2010.svg|thumb|A variation of the network's current logo which resembles its original logo, used {{as of|2010|lc=y}}. It is also used as the production logo at the end of their shows since November 10, 2016.]]
A new identity for the channel was introduced on May 29, 2010, along with a new theme and new bumpers. The network's current branding, designed by [[Brand New School]], makes heavy use of the black and white checkerboard which made up the network's first logo (and was carried over in a minimized form to the second logo), as well as various [[CMYK]] color variations and various patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/on_the_air/2010/05/cartoon-network-unveils-new-logo-image-campaign.html| title= Cartoon Network unveils new logo, image campaign|first=Michael|last=Schneider|date=May 28, 2010|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 27, 2010, Adult Swim expanded by one hour, moving its start time from 10 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/adult-swim-preps-deeper-dive-prime-114737| title= Adult Swim Preps for Deeper Dive Into Prime|first=Anthony|last=Crupi|date=February 14, 2010|work=[[Adweek]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011, Cartoon Network aired its first sports award show  ''[[Hall of Game Awards]]'', hosted that year by professional skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]].

After announcing two new live-action shows in ''[[Unnatural History (TV series)|Unnatural History]]'' and ''[[Tower Prep]]'', which were both cancelled after their first seasons, Cartoon Network acquired the game show, ''[[Hole in the Wall (U.S. game show)|Hole in the Wall]]'' (originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]). By the end of 2011, ''Hole in the Wall'' and the final two CN Real shows, ''Destroy Build Destroy'' and ''Dude, What Would Happen?'' were removed from Cartoon Network's schedule completely. In 2012, Cartoon Network acquired the television rights to ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', based on the web series, ''[[The Annoying Orange]]'' and added it to its primetime lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bakersfieldcalifornian.com/local/bakosphere/x986930791/Cartoon-Network-signs-Annoying-Orange|title= Cartoon Network signs 'Annoying Orange'|date=November 22, 2011|work=Bakersfield.com|accessdate=2012-10-24}}{{dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2014, Cartoon Network, along with CNN and Boomerang, were taken off the [[Dish Network]] in the United States after Turner Broadcasting declined to renew its contract with the Dish Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/10/21/turner-networks-off-dish-lineup/17671019/|title=Turner networks taken off Dish lineup on contract row|author=Roger Yu, USA TODAY|date=21 October 2014|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The channels were restored on November 21, 2014.

On May 30, 2016, Cartoon Network USA refreshed the channel with a new graphics package based on previous rebrands in the Check It family called &quot;Dimensional&quot;, the new graphics were developed by Bent Design Lab and features cartoon characters in 3D CGI, stop-motion, and 2D graphic techniques.

==Programming==
{{Main article|List of programs broadcast by Cartoon Network}}
Cartoon Network's current programming includes original programming such as ''[[Adventure Time]]'', ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'', ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'', ''[[Steven Universe]]'', ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'', ''[[We Bare Bears]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|The Powerpuff Girls (Reboot)]]'', and ''[[Mighty Magiswords]]''. A new show premiered on January 2, 2017, called ''[[My Knight and Me]].'' Acquired animated programming from other studios as of January 28, 2017 includes ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'', ''[[Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu]]'', ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', and ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''. Cartoon Network formerly had rights to airing ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' until the episode The Legend of X, Y, and Z! where it is moving to ''[[Disney XD]]'' as of 2017 for the ''[[List of Pokémon: Sun &amp; Moon episodes|Pokémon Sun and Moon Series]]''. Live-action programming, only introduced in recent years, formerly included original live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and live-action original productions such as  ''[[Level Up (TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''. In addition, the network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which has been in constant rotation since Cartoon Network's 1992 launch.

Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Especially in its earlier years, the company's co-ownership with Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time&quot;&gt;Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original series===
{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}
'''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network since 2003, with newer originals being branded as '''Cartoon Network Original Series'''. Much of said original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, Cartoon Network Studios. The studio originally began as a division of Hanna-Barbera, but eventually was spun off when H-B was folded into [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in 2001. This studio would produce some of the network's earliest Cartoon Cartoons, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''.

===Programming blocks===
By the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[Preschool education|preschoolers]] as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience were [[Tween (demographic)|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''.

==Marketing==
Cartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time5&quot;&gt;Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]], while ''[[Cardcaptor Sakura|Cardcaptors]]'', an anime licensed by Kids' WB, was at times seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive contents for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time5&quot;/&gt;

[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that the film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time5&quot;/&gt;

==Controversy and censorship==
Cartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time6&quot;&gt;Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107&lt;/ref&gt;

There was media attention in 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts that had become controversial for using [[ethnic stereotype]]s, albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure no children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent, however, considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, &quot;We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prime Time6&quot;/&gt;

===Toonami===
{{Main article|Toonami}}
Toonami (a portmanteau of &quot;cartoon&quot; and &quot;[[tsunami]]&quot;, suggesting a &quot;tidal wave&quot; of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared &quot;Midnight Run&quot; incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].

The Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.

[[Toonami (Asia)|Toonami]] was launched as a 24-hour channel in Asia in December 2011. &quot;It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,&quot; said Sunny Saha from Turner International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&amp;nbsp;— Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
