&lt;!-- Definitions and symptoms --&gt;
'''Ebola virus disease''' ('''EVD'''), also known as '''Ebola hemorrhagic fever''' ('''EHF''') or simply '''Ebola''', is a [[viral hemorrhagic fever]] of humans and other [[primate]]s caused by [[ebolavirus]]es.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; --&gt; Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a [[fever]], [[sore throat]], [[Myalgia|muscular pain]], and [[headaches]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; --&gt; Then, [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]] and [[rash]] usually follow, along with decreased function of the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; --&gt; At this time some people begin to [[bleeding|bleed]] both [[internal bleeding|internally]] and externally.&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web | title = Ebola virus disease Fact sheet No. 103|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/|work=World Health Organization | date = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected, with an average of about 50 percent.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This is often due to [[hypovolemic shock|low blood pressure from fluid loss]], and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.&lt;ref name=Ruz2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruzek|first1=edited by Sunit K.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis--&gt;
The virus spreads by direct contact with [[body fluid]]s, such as [[blood]], of an infected human or other animals.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This may also occur through contact with an item recently contaminated with bodily fluids.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions.&lt;ref name=WHOAir2014&gt;{{cite web | title = 2014 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa | url = http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en/ | publisher = WHO | accessdate = 3 August 2014 | date = 21 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Semen]] or [[breast milk]] of a person after recovery from EVD may carry the virus for several weeks to months.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdc9months&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p1014-ebola-virus.html|title=Preliminary study finds that Ebola virus fragments can persist in the semen of some survivors for at least nine months|publisher=CDC|date=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDCBreast2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Recommendations for Breastfeeding/Infant Feeding in the Context of Ebola|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/recommendations-breastfeeding-infant-feeding-ebola.html|website=cdc.gov|accessdate=26 October 2014|date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Megabat|Fruit bat]]s are believed to be the normal [[natural host|carrier in nature]], able to spread the virus without being affected by it.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; --&gt; Other diseases such as [[malaria]], [[cholera]], [[typhoid fever]], [[meningitis]] and other viral hemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; --&gt; Blood samples are tested for viral [[RNA]], viral [[antibodies]] or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;

&lt;!--Prevention and management --&gt;
Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services, alongside a certain level of community engagement.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; --&gt; The medical services include rapid detection of cases of disease, [[contact tracing]] of those who have come into contact with infected individuals, quick access to laboratory services, proper healthcare for those who are infected, and proper disposal of the dead through [[cremation]] or burial.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/hcp/guidance-safe-handling-human-remains-ebola-patients-us-hospitals-mortuaries.html|title=Guidance for Safe Handling of Human Remains of Ebola Patients in U.

===Onset===
&lt;!-- Incubation --&gt;
The length of time between exposure to the virus and the development of symptoms ([[incubation period]]) is between 2 and 21 days,&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2014S&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Signs and Symptoms|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/symptoms/index.html | website = CDC | accessdate = 2 August 2014 | date= 28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually between 4 and 10 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goeijenbier2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Goeijenbier M, van Kampen JJ, Reusken CB, Koopmans MP, van Gorp EC | title=Ebola virus disease: a review on epidemiology, symptoms, treatment and pathogenesis|journal=Neth J Med|volume=72|issue=9|pages= 442–8|date=November 2014|pmid=25387613|url=http://www.njmonline.nl/getpdf.php?t=a&amp;id=10001148}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent estimates based on mathematical models predict that around 5% of cases may take greater than 21 days to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author1=Charles N.

&lt;!-- Early --&gt;
Symptoms usually begin with a sudden [[influenza]]-like stage characterized by [[fatigue (medical)|feeling tired]], [[fever]], [[asthenia|weakness]], [[anorexia (symptom)|decreased appetite]], [[myalgia|muscular pain]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], headache, and sore throat.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goeijenbier2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatherer 2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gatherer D|title=The 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa|journal=J Gen Virol|volume=95|issue=Pt 8|pages=1619–1624|date=August 2014|pmid=24795448|doi=10.1099/vir.0.067199-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hun2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magill|first1=Alan|author1-link=Alan Magill|title=Hunter's tropical medicine and emerging infectious diseases.|date=2013|publisher=Saunders|location=New York|isbn=9781416043904|page=332|edition=9th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgvdM8WRld4C&amp;pg=PA332}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fever is usually higher than {{convert|38.3|°C|°F|0}}.&lt;ref name=Hoenen2006 /&gt; This is often followed by vomiting, [[diarrhea]] and abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=Hun2012/&gt; Next, [[shortness of breath]] and [[chest pain]] may occur, along with [[edema|swelling]], [[headaches]] and [[decreased level of consciousness|confusion]].&lt;ref name=Hun2012/&gt; In about half of the cases, the skin may develop a [[maculopapular rash]], a flat red area covered with small bumps, 5 to 7 days after symptoms begin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goeijenbier2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoenen2006 /&gt;

===Bleeding===

===Recovery and death===
Recovery may begin between 7 and 14&amp;nbsp;days after first symptoms.&lt;ref name=Hun2012/&gt; Death, if it occurs, follows typically 6 to 16 days from first symptoms and is often due to [[hypovolemic shock|low blood pressure from fluid loss]].&lt;ref name=Ruz2014/&gt; In general, bleeding often indicates a worse outcome, and blood loss may result in death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatherer 2014&quot; /&gt; People are often in a [[coma]] near the end of life.&lt;ref name=Hun2012/&gt;

Those who survive often have ongoing muscular and joint pain, [[hepatitis|liver inflammation]], decreased hearing, and may have continued tiredness, continued weakness, decreased appetite, and difficulty returning to pre-illness weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hun2012&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosh2014&quot; /&gt; Problems with vision may develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An emergency within an emergency: caring for Ebola survivors|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/sierra-leone/press-materials/item/7908-an-emergency-within-an-emergency-caring-for-ebola-survivors.html|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, survivors develop [[antibodies]] against Ebola that last at least 10 years, but it is unclear if they are immune to repeated infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDC2014QAT&quot; /&gt;

==Cause==
EVD in humans is caused by four of five viruses of the genus ''[[Ebolavirus]]''. The four are [[Bundibugyo virus]] (BDBV), [[Sudan virus]] (SUDV), [[Ta&amp;iuml; Forest virus]] (TAFV) and one simply called [[Ebola virus]] (EBOV, formerly Zaire Ebola virus).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoenen2012&quot;/&gt; EBOV, species ''[[Zaire ebolavirus]]'', is the most dangerous of the known EVD-causing viruses, and is responsible for the largest number of outbreaks.&lt;ref name=KuhnArch&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuhn JH, Becker S, Ebihara H, Geisbert TW, Johnson KM, Kawaoka Y, Lipkin WI, Negredo AI, Netesov SV, Nichol ST, Palacios G, Peters CJ, Tenorio A, Volchkov VE, Jahrling PB | title = Proposal for a revised taxonomy of the family Filoviridae: Classification, names of taxa and viruses, and virus abbreviations | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 155 | issue = 12 | pages = 2083–103 |date=December 2010 | pmid = 21046175 | pmc = 3074192 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-010-0814-x  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth virus, [[Reston virus]] (RESTV), is not thought to cause disease in humans, but has caused disease in other primates.&lt;ref name=Spickler&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spickler|first1=Anna|title=Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus Infections|url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/viral_hemorrhagic_fever_filovirus.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Ebola Virus Disease|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/about.html|website=CDC|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All five viruses are closely related to [[marburgvirus]]es.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoenen2012&quot;/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Ebola Pathenogensis path.svg|thumb|[[Pathogenesis]] schematic]]

Similar to other filoviruses, EBOV replicates very efficiently in many [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|cells]], producing large amounts of virus in [[monocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s and other cells including [[hepatocyte|liver cells]], [[fibroblast]]s, and [[adrenal gland|adrenal gland cells]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ansari2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ansari AA|title=Clinical features and pathobiology of Ebolavirus infection|journal=J Autoimmun|volume=55|pages=1–9|date=September 2014|pmid=25260583|doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral replication triggers the [[cytokine storm|release of high levels of inflammatory chemical signals]] and leads to a [[Sepsis|septic state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosh2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tosh PK, Sampathkumar P |title=What Clinicians Should Know About the 2014 Ebola Outbreak|journal=Mayo Clin Proc|volume=89|issue=12|pages=1710–17|date=December 2014|pmid=25467644|doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.10.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBOV is thought to infect humans through contact with mucous membranes or through skin breaks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funk2014&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Funk DJ, Kumar A |title=Ebola virus disease: an update for anesthesiologists and intensivists|journal=Can J Anaesth|volume=62|issue=1|pages=80–91|date=November 2014|pmid=25373801|doi=10.1007/s12630-014-0257-z|pmc=4286619}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once infected, [[endothelial cells]] (cells lining the inside of blood vessels),  liver cells, and several types of immune cells such as [[Mononuclear phagocyte system|macrophages, monocytes]], and dendritic cells are the main targets of infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funk2014&quot;/&gt; Following infection with the virus, the immune cells carry the virus to nearby [[lymph node]]s where further reproduction of the virus takes place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funk2014&quot;/&gt; From there, the virus can enter the bloodstream and [[lymphatic system]] and spread throughout the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funk2014&quot;/&gt; Macrophages are the first cells infected with the virus, and this infection results in [[Apoptosis|programmed cell death]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chippaux2014&quot;/&gt; Other types of [[white blood cell]]s, such as [[lymphocyte]]s, also undergo programmed cell death leading to an abnormally [[lymphocytopenia|low concentration of lymphocytes]] in the blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funk2014&quot;/&gt; This contributes to the weakened immune response seen in those infected with EBOV.&lt;ref name=&quot;Funk2014&quot;/&gt;

Endothelial cells may be infected within three days after exposure to the virus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chippaux2014&quot;/&gt; The breakdown of endothelial cells leading to [[blood vessel]] injury can be attributed to EBOV [[glycoprotein]]s. This damage occurs due to the synthesis of Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP), which reduces the availability of specific [[integrin]]s responsible for cell adhesion to the intercellular structure and causes liver damage, leading to [[coagulopathy|improper clotting]]. The widespread [[bleeding]] that occurs in affected people causes [[edema|swelling]] and [[Hypovolemic shock|shock due to loss of blood volume]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7910-8505-8&quot;/&gt; The [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation|dysfunction in bleeding and clotting]] commonly seen in EVD has been attributed to increased activation of the [[Tissue factor pathway|extrinsic pathway]] of the coagulation cascade due to excessive [[tissue factor]] production by macrophages and monocytes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goeijenbier2014&quot;/&gt;

After infection, a secreted [[glycoprotein]], small soluble glycoprotein (sGP or GP) is synthesized. EBOV replication overwhelms protein synthesis of infected cells and the host immune defenses. The GP forms a [[Trimer (biochemistry)|trimeric complex]], which tethers the virus to the endothelial cells. The sGP forms a [[protein dimer|dimeric protein]] that interferes with the signaling of [[neutrophils]], another type of white blood cell, which enables the virus to evade the immune system by inhibiting early steps of neutrophil activation. The presence of viral particles and the cell damage resulting from viruses budding out of the cell causes the release of [[cytokines|chemical signals]] (such as [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-α]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]] and [[Interleukin 8|IL-8]]), which are molecular signals for fever and inflammation.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Filoviral infection also interferes with proper functioning of the [[innate immune system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Misasi2014&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Olejnik2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olejnik J, Ryabchikova E, Corley RB, Mühlberger E | title = Intracellular events and cell fate in filovirus infection | journal = Viruses | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | pages = 1501–31 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21927676 | pmc = 3172725 | doi = 10.3390/v3081501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EBOV proteins blunt the human immune system's response to viral infections by interfering with the cells' ability to produce and respond to interferon proteins such as [[interferon-alpha]], [[interferon-beta]], and [[interferon gamma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhl2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramanan2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramanan P, Shabman RS, Brown CS, Amarasinghe GK, Basler CF, Leung DW | title = Filoviral immune evasion mechanisms | journal = Viruses | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 1634–49 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21994800 | pmc = 3187693 | doi = 10.3390/v3091634 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VP24 and VP35  structural proteins of EBOV play a key role in this interference. When a cell is infected with EBOV, receptors located in the cell's [[cytosol]] (such as [[RIG-I]] and [[MDA5]]) or outside of the cytosol (such as [[Toll-like receptor 3|Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)]], [[Toll-like receptor 7|TLR7]], [[Toll-like receptor 8|TLR8]] and [[Toll-like receptor 9|TLR9]]), recognize [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|infectious molecules]] associated with the virus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhl2012&quot;/&gt; On TLR activation, proteins including [[Interferon Regulatory Factor 3|interferon regulatory factor 3]] and [[Interferon regulatory factor-7|interferon regulatory factor 7]] trigger a signaling cascade that leads to the expression of [[type 1 interferon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhl2012&quot;/&gt; The type 1 interferons are then released and bind to the [[IFNAR1]] and [[IFNAR2]] receptors expressed on the surface of a neighboring cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhl2012&quot;/&gt; Once interferon has bound to its receptors on the neighboring cell, the signaling proteins [[STAT1]] and [[STAT2]] are activated and move to the [[Cell nucleus|cell's nucleus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhl2012&quot;/&gt; This triggers the expression of [[Interferome|interferon-stimulated genes]], which code for proteins with antiviral properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhl2012&quot;/&gt; EBOV's V24 protein blocks the production of these antiviral proteins by preventing the STAT1 signaling protein in the neighboring cell from entering the nucleus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhl2012&quot;/&gt; The VP35 protein directly inhibits the production of interferon-beta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramanan2011&quot;/&gt; By inhibiting these immune responses, EBOV may quickly spread throughout the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chippaux2014&quot;/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
When EVD is suspected in a person, his or her travel and work history, along with an exposure to wildlife, are important factors to consider with respect to further diagnostic efforts.

===Laboratory testing===
Possible non-specific laboratory indicators of EVD include a [[thrombocytopenia|low platelet count]]; an initially [[leukopenia|decreased white blood cell count]] followed by an [[leukocytosis|increased white blood cell count]]; elevated levels of the liver enzymes [[alanine aminotransferase]] (ALT) and [[aspartate aminotransferase]] (AST); and abnormalities in blood clotting often consistent with [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC) such as a prolonged [[prothrombin time]], [[partial thromboplastin time]], and [[bleeding time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kortepeter2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kortepeter MG, Bausch DG, Bray M | title = Basic clinical and laboratory features of filoviral hemorrhagic fever | journal = J Infect Dis | volume = 204 | issue = Supplement 3 | pages = S810–6 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21987756 | doi = 10.1093/infdis/jir299 | url = http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_3/S810.long }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filovirions, such as EBOV, may be identified by their unique filamentous shapes in cell cultures examined with [[electron microscopy]], but this method cannot distinguish the various filoviruses.&lt;ref name=Geisbert1995&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Geisbert TW, Jahrling PB |title=Differentiation of filoviruses by electron microscopy|journal=Virus Res|volume=39|issue=2–3 |pages=129–50|date=December 1995|pmid=8837880|doi=10.1016/0168-1702(95)00080-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific diagnosis of EVD is confirmed by isolating the virus, detecting its [[RNA]] or proteins, or detecting [[antibodies]] against the virus in a person's blood.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=CDC2014Diag/&gt; --&gt; Isolating the virus by [[cell culture]], detecting the viral RNA by [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR)&lt;ref name=&quot;Goeijenbier2014&quot;/&gt; and detecting proteins by [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]] (ELISA) are methods best used in the early stages of the disease and also for detecting the virus in human remains.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=CDC2014Diag/&gt; --&gt; Detecting antibodies against the virus is most reliable in the later stages of the disease and in those who recover.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Diag&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Diagnosis|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/diagnosis/index.html|website=CDC|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM antibodies]] are detectable two days after symptom onset and [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG antibodies]] can be detected 6 to 18 days after symptom onset.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goeijenbier2014&quot;/&gt; During an outbreak, isolation of the virus via cell culture methods is often not feasible.

===Differential diagnosis===
Early symptoms of EVD may be similar to those of other diseases common in Africa, including [[malaria]] and [[dengue fever]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gatherer 2014&quot;/&gt; The symptoms are also similar to those of other viral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Marburg virus disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine | publisher=McGraw-Hill | editor-last=Longo | editor-first=DL | editor-last2=Kasper | editor-first2=DL | editor-last3=Jameson| editor-first3=JL | editor-last4=Fauci | editor-first4=AS | editor-last5=Hauser | editor-first5=SL | editor-last6=Loscalzo | editor-first6=J | year=2012 | chapter=Chapter 197 | edition=18th | isbn=0-07-174889-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete [[differential diagnosis]] is extensive and requires consideration of many other infectious diseases such as [[typhoid fever]], [[shigellosis]], [[rickettsia|rickettsial diseases]], [[cholera]], [[sepsis]], [[borreliosis]], [[Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli|EHEC enteritis]], [[leptospirosis]], [[scrub typhus]], [[plague (disease)|plague]], [[Q fever]], [[candidiasis]], [[histoplasmosis]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[visceral]] [[leishmaniasis]], [[measles]], and [[viral hepatitis]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viral Hemorrhagic Fever |url=https://www.sfcdcp.org/document.html?id=316 |website=San Francisco Department of Public Health |publisher=Communicable Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=17 August 2014 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420174306/http://www.sfcdcp.org/document.html?id=316 |archivedate=20 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-infectious diseases that may result in symptoms similar to those of EVD include [[acute promyelocytic leukemia]], [[hemolytic uremic syndrome]], [[snake envenomation]], [[coagulation|clotting factor]] deficiencies/platelet disorders, [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]], [[hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia]], [[Kawasaki disease]], and [[warfarin]] poisoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolla2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gear1989&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gear JH|title=Clinical aspects of African viral hemorrhagic fevers|journal=Rev Infect Dis|volume=11|issue=Supplement 4|pages=S777–82|date=May–June 1989|pmid=2665013|doi=10.1093/clinids/11.supplement_4.s777}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gear1978&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gear JH, Ryan J, Rossouw E | title = A consideration of the diagnosis of dangerous infectious fevers in South Africa | journal = South African medical [Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde] | volume = 53 | issue = 7 | pages = 235–237 |date=February 1978 | pmid = 565951 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogomolov1998&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bogomolov BP | title = Differential diagnosis of infectious diseases with hemorrhagic syndrome | journal = Terapevticheskii arkhiv | volume = 70 | issue = 4 | pages = 63–68 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9612907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* encounter with a person showing symptoms; but not within 3 feet of the person with Ebola without wearing PPE; and no direct contact of body fluids
* having had brief skin contact with a person showing symptoms of Ebola disease when the person was believed to be not very contagious (low risk)
* in countries without widespread Ebola disease transmission: direct contact with a person showing symptoms of the disease while wearing PPE (low risk)
* contact with a person with Ebola disease before the person was showing symptoms (no risk).

===Contact tracing===
[[Contact tracing]] is considered important to contain an outbreak. It involves finding everyone who had close contact with infected individuals and watching for signs of illness for 21 days. If any of these contacts comes down with the disease, they should be isolated, tested and treated. Then the process is repeated by tracing the contacts' contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebola 2014 — New Challenges, New Global Response and Responsibility|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1409903?query=featured_ebola|website=NEJM|publisher=New England Journal of Medicine|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Contact Tracing?|url=http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/contact-tracing.pdf|website=CDC|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blood products such as [[packed red blood cells]], [[platelet]]s or [[fresh frozen plasma]] may also be used.&lt;ref name=Clark_2012/&gt; Other regulators of coagulation have also been tried including [[heparin]] in an effort to prevent [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] and [[Coagulation factors|clotting factors]] to decrease bleeding.&lt;ref name=Clark_2012/&gt; [[Antimalarial medication]]s and [[antibiotics]] are often used before the diagnosis is confirmed,&lt;ref name=Clark_2012/&gt; though there is no evidence to suggest such treatment helps. A number of [[Ebola virus disease treatment research|experimental treatments are being studied]].

If hospital care is not possible, the World Health Organization has guidelines for care at home that have been relatively successful. In such situations, recommendations include using towels soaked in bleach solutions when moving infected people or bodies and applying bleach on stains. It is also recommended that the caregivers wash hands with bleach solutions and cover their mouth and nose with a cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/Annex_18_risk_reduction_home_care.pdf?ua=1|title=Annex 18.

===Intensive care===
[[Intensive care]] is often used in the developed world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldmann2011&quot; /&gt; This may include maintaining blood volume and electrolytes (salts) balance as well as treating any bacterial infections that may develop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldmann2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Feldmann H, Geisbert TW |title=Ebola haemorrhagic fever|journal=Lancet|volume=377|issue=9768|pages=849–62| date=March 2011|pmid=21084112|pmc=3406178|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hemodialysis|Dialysis]] may be needed for [[kidney failure]], and [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] may be used for lung dysfunction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldmann2011&quot; /&gt;

==Prognosis==
EVD has a high [[case fatality rate|risk of death in those infected]] which varies between 25 percent and 90 percent of those infected.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elsevier/Academic Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.M.

Death, if it occurs, follows typically six to sixteen days after symptoms appear and is often due to [[hypovolemic shock|low blood pressure from fluid loss]].&lt;ref name=Ruz2014/&gt; Early supportive care to prevent dehydration may reduce the risk of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlBBC News – Who, What, Why: How many people infected with ebola die?&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-28713923 | title = Who, What, Why: How many people infected with ebola die? | work = BBC News | date = 9 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an infected person survives, recovery may be quick and complete. Prolonged cases are often complicated by the occurrence of long-term problems, such as [[orchitis|inflammation of the testicles]], [[arthralgia|joint pains]], [[myalgia|muscular pain]], [[desquamation|skin peeling]], or [[alopecia|hair loss]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goeijenbier2014&quot;/&gt; Eye symptoms, such as [[photophobia|light sensitivity]], [[hyperlacrimation|excess tearing]], and [[vision loss]] have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiwanitkit|first1=S|last2=Wiwanitkit|first2=V|title=Ocular problem in Ebola virus infection: A short review.|journal=Saudi Journal of Ophthalmology|date=2015|volume=29|issue=3|pages=225–6|pmid=26155084|doi=10.1016/j.sjopt.2015.02.006|pmc=4487942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intense contact tracing and strict isolation techniques largely prevented further spread of the disease in the countries that had imported cases; this disease is still ongoing in Guinea.  {{#section:Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|casesasof}}, {{#section:Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|cases}} suspected cases and {{#section:Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|deaths}} deaths have been reported;{{#section:Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|caserefs}}&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/index.html|title = 2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa – Case Counts|date = 2014|website =2014 Ebola Outbreak in West Africa |publisher = CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the WHO has said that these numbers may be underestimated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebola_Outbreak_total_WHO_28_Sept&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/135600/1/roadmapsitrep_1Oct2014_eng.pdf?ua=1 | title = Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report | publisher = World Health Organization | work = | date = 1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because they work closely with the body fluids of infected patients, healthcare workers have been especially vulnerable to catching the disease; in August 2014, the WHO reported that ten percent of the dead have been healthcare workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unprecedented number of medical staff infected with Ebola|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/25-august-2014/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=29 August 2014|date=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, it was estimated that the countries' capacity for treating Ebola patients was insufficient by the equivalent of 2,122 beds; by December there were a sufficient number of beds to treat and isolate all reported Ebola cases, although the uneven distribution of cases was  resulting in serious shortfalls in some areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO2014_12_10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/145198/1/roadmapsitrep_10Dec2014_eng.pdf?ua=1  |format= PDF|title=Ebola response roadmap - Situation report|publisher=World Health Organization|date=10 December 2014|accessdate =11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 January 2015, the WHO reported that for the first time since the week ending 29 June 2014, there had been fewer than 100 new confirmed cases reported in a week in the three most-affected countries.

Soon after Lokela's death, others who had been in contact with him also died, and people in the village of Yambuku began to panic. This led the country's Minister of Health along with Zaire President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] to declare the entire region, including Yambuku and the country's capital, [[Kinshasa]], a quarantine zone. No one was permitted to enter or leave the area, with roads, waterways, and airfields placed under [[martial law]].

The outbreak lasted 26 days, with the quarantine lasting 2 weeks. Among the reasons that researchers speculated caused the disease to disappear, were the precautions taken by locals, the quarantine of the area, and discontinuing the injections.&lt;ref name=Stimola/&gt;

During this outbreak, Dr. Ngoy Mushola recorded the first clinical description of EVD in [[Yambuku]], where he wrote the following in his daily log: &quot;The illness is characterized with a high temperature of about {{convert|39|°C|0}}, [[hematemesis]], diarrhea with blood, retrosternal abdominal pain, prostration with 'heavy' articulations, and rapid evolution death after a mean of 3 days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bardi|first1=Jason Socrates|title=Death Called a River|url=http://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20020114/ebola1.html|website=The Scripps Research Institute|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The virus responsible for the initial outbreak, first thought to be [[Marburg virus]], was later identified as a new type of virus related to marburgviruses.

Recovered carcasses from gorillas contain multiple Ebola virus strains, which suggest multiple introductions of the virus. Bodies decompose quickly and carcasses are not infectious after 3 to 4 days. Contact between gorilla groups is rare, suggesting transmission among gorilla groups is unlikely, and that outbreaks result from transmission between viral reservoir and animal populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1126/science.1092528&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leroy EM, Rouquet P, Formenty P, Souquière S, Kilbourne A, Froment JM, Bermejo M, Smit S, Karesh W, Swanepoel R, Zaki SR, Rollin PE | title = Multiple Ebola virus transmission events and rapid decline of central African wildlife | journal = Science | volume = 303 | issue = 5656 | pages = 387–390 |date=January 2004 | pmid = 14726594 | doi = 10.1126/science.1092528 | bibcode = 2004Sci...303..387L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic animals===
In 2012 it was demonstrated that the virus can travel without contact from pigs to nonhuman primates, although the same study failed to achieve transmission in that manner between primates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weingartl_2013&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weingartl2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weingartl HM, Embury-Hyatt C, Nfon C, Leung A, Smith G, Kobinger G | title = Transmission of Ebola virus from pigs to non-human primates | journal = Sci Rep | volume = 2 | issue = | page = 811 |date=November 2012 | pmid = 23155478 | pmc = 3498927 | doi = 10.1038/srep00811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs may become infected with EBOV but not develop symptoms. Dogs in some parts of Africa [[scavenge]] for food, and they sometimes eat EBOV-infected animals and also the corpses of humans. A 2005 survey of dogs during an EBOV outbreak found that although they remain asymptomatic, about 32 percent of dogs closest to an outbreak showed a [[seroprevalence]] for EBOV  versus 9 percent of those farther away.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15757552&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Allela L, Boury O, Pouillot R, Délicat A, Yaba P, Kumulungui B, Rouquet P, Gonzalez JP, Leroy EM | title = Ebola virus antibody prevalence in dogs and human risk | journal = Emerging Infect.

===Reston virus===
{{For|more about the outbreak in Virginia, US|Reston virus}}
In late 1989, Hazelton Research Products' Reston Quarantine Unit in [[Reston, Virginia]], suffered an outbreak of fatal illness amongst certain lab monkeys. This lab outbreak was initially diagnosed as [[simian hemorrhagic fever virus]] (SHFV) and occurred amongst a shipment of [[crab-eating macaque]] monkeys imported from the Philippines. Hazelton's veterinary pathologist sent tissue samples from dead animals to the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] (USAMRIID) at [[Fort Detrick, Maryland]], where an [[ELISA]] test indicated the antibodies present in the tissue were a response to Ebola virus and not SHFV.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Hot Zone | publisher=Random House | author=Preston, Richard | year=1994 | location=New York | page=300 | isbn=978-0679437840}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electron microscopist from USAMRIID discovered [[filoviruses]] similar in appearance to Ebola in the tissue samples sent from Hazelton Research Products' Reston Quarantine Unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick 1999 277–279&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McCormick|Fisher-Hoch|1999|pp=277–279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[US Army]] team headquartered at USAMRIID [[Euthanisia|euthanized]] the surviving monkeys, and brought all the monkeys to [[Ft. Detrick]] for study by the Army's veterinary pathologists and virologists, and eventual disposal under safe conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston&quot; /&gt; Blood samples were taken from 178 animal handlers during the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterman 1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Waterman|first=Tara|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/virus/filo/ebor.html|title=Ebola Reston Outbreaks|accessdate=2 August 2008|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, six animal handlers eventually [[seroconverted]], including one who had cut himself with a bloody scalpel.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-7910-8505-8&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Smith, Tara |title=Ebola (Deadly Diseases and Epidemics) |publisher=Chelsea House Publications |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-7910-8505-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick 1999 298–299&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|McCormick|Fisher-Hoch|1999|pp=298–299}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its status as a [[Biosafety level 4|Level‑4]] organism and its apparent [[pathogen]]icity in monkeys, when the handlers did not become ill, the CDC concluded that the virus had a very low pathogenicity to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCormick 1999 298–299&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCormick|Fisher-Hoch|1999|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines and the United States had no previous cases of Ebola infection, and upon further isolation, researchers concluded it was another strain of Ebola, or a new filovirus of Asian origin, which they named ''[[Reston ebolavirus]]'' (RESTV) after the location of the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preston&quot; /&gt; Reston virus (RESTV) can be transmitted to pigs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weingartl_2013&quot;/&gt; Since the initial outbreak it has since been found in nonhuman [[primate]]s in Pennsylvania, Texas, and Italy,&lt;ref name=&quot;KnownCasesCDC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://origin.glb.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/history/chronology.html |title=Outbreaks Chronology: Ebola Virus Disease|accessdate=26 October 2014| website=cdc.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the virus had infected pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/health/24ebola.html|title=Pig-to-Human Ebola Case Suspected in Philippines|accessdate=26 January 2009|date=24 January 2009|publisher=New York Times | first=Donald G. | last=McNeil Jr}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the WHO, routine cleaning and disinfection of pig (or monkey) farms with [[sodium hypochlorite]] or [[detergents]] should be effective in inactivating the ''Reston ebolavirus''. Pigs that have been infected with RESTV tend to show [[symptoms]] of the disease.

{{Main article|Ebola virus disease treatment research}}
[[File:monoclonal antibodies3.jpg|thumb|Researchers looking at slides of cultures of cells that make [[monoclonal antibodies]]. These are grown in a lab and the researchers are analyzing the products to select the most promising.]]

As of July 2015, there is no medication which has been proven to be safe and effective in treating Ebola.  By the time the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] began in 2013, there were at least nine different candidate treatments.  Several trials were conducted in late 2014 and early 2015, but some were abandoned due to lack of efficacy or lack of people to study.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Diagnostic tests===

One issue which hinders control of Ebola is that diagnostic tests which are currently available require specialized equipment and highly trained personnel. Since there are few suitable testing centers in West Africa, this leads to delay in diagnosis. In December 2014, a conference in Geneva will aim to work out which diagnostic tools could be to identify Ebola reliably and more quickly. The meeting, convened by the WHO and the non-profit [[Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics]], seeks to identify tests that can be used by untrained staff, do not require electricity or can run on batteries or solar power and use reagents that can withstand temperatures of 40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebola Experts Seek to Expand Testing|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ebola-experts-seek-to-expand-testing/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 November 2014, a new 15-minute Ebola test was reported that if successful, &quot;not only gives patients a better chance of survival, but it prevents transmission of the virus to other people.&quot; The new equipment, about the size of a laptop and solar-powered, allows testing to be done in remote areas. The equipment is currently being tested in Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/ebola-outbreak-new-15minute-test-trialled-in-guinea-offers-hope-for-thousands-9892543.html|title=Ebola outbreak: New 15-minute test offers hope for thousands|work=The Independent|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December 2014, the FDA approved LightMix (R) Ebola Zaire rRT-PCR Test on patients with symptoms of Ebola. The report indicates it could help health care authorities around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/roche-secures-emergency-approval-by-u-s-regulators-for-ebola-test-1419840858|title=Roche Secures Emergency Approval by U.S. Regulators for Ebola Test|author=Marta Falconi|date=29 December 2014|work=WSJ|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
