'''Google''' is an American [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[technology company]] specializing in [[Internet]]-related services and products. These include [[online advertising]] technologies, [[Web search engine|search]], [[cloud computing]], [[software]], and [[Computer hardware|hardware]].

&lt;!-- history --&gt;Google was founded in 1996 by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] while they were [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] students at [[Stanford University]], in California. Together, they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through [[supervoting stock]]. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An [[initial public offering]] (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004, and Google moved to its new headquarters in [[Mountain View, California]], nicknamed the [[Googleplex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/about/company/history/#2004 |title=Google history in depth|website=Google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] called [[Alphabet Inc.]] Google, Alphabet's leading subsidiary, will continue to be the umbrella company for Alphabet's Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructure, [[Sundar Pichai]] became [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Google, replacing [[Larry Page]], who became CEO of Alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alphabet introduction&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alphabet Bloomberg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alphabet WSJ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alphabet NYT&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- portfolio --&gt;Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]], and partnerships beyond [[Google Search|Google's core search engine]] ([[Google Search]]). It offers services designed for work and productivity ([[Google Docs, Sheets and Slides]]), [[Webmail|email]] ([[Gmail]]/[[Inbox by Gmail|Inbox]]), scheduling and time management ([[Google Calendar]]), [[file hosting service|cloud storage]] ([[Google Drive]]), [[social networking service|social networking]] ([[Google+]]), instant messaging and video chat ([[Google Allo]]/[[Google Duo|Duo]]/[[Google Hangouts|Hangouts]]), language translation ([[Google Translate]]), mapping and turn-by-turn navigation ([[Google Maps]]), video sharing ([[YouTube]]), notetaking ([[Google Keep]]), and photo organizing and [[Image editing|editing]] ([[Google Photos]]). The company leads the development of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile [[operating system]], the [[Google Chrome]] web browser, and [[Chrome OS]], a lightweight operating system based on the Chrome browser. Google has moved increasingly into hardware; from 2010 to 2015, it partnered with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its [[Google Nexus|Nexus]] devices,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardware company&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Official: Google Is Now a Hardware Company|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-22/its-official-google-is-now-a-hardware-company|accessdate=September 4, 2012|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=May 22, 2012|author= Stone, Brad|author2= Burrows, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2016, it launched multiple hardware products (the [[Pixel (smartphone)|Google Pixel]] smartphone, [[Google Home|Home]], [[Google Wifi|Wifi]], and [[Google Daydream|Daydream View]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Pixel announcement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Home announcement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Wifi announcement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Daydream View announcement&quot;/&gt; The new hardware chief, Rick Osterloh, stated: &quot;a lot of the innovation that we want to do now ends up requiring controlling the end-to-end user experience&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Google Phone Interview&quot;/&gt; 

Google has also experimented with becoming an Internet network operator. In February 2010, it announced [[Google Fiber]], a fiber-optic infrastructure that was installed in [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Fiber&quot;/&gt; in April 2015, it launched [[Project Fi]], combining Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different providers in an effort to create a seamless and fast wireless Internet experience;&lt;ref name=&quot;Project Fi&quot;/&gt; and in 2016, the company launched the Google Station initiative to make public &quot;high-quality, secure, easily accessible Wi-Fi&quot; around the world, which had already been deployed in [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Station&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- technical --&gt;An August 2011 report estimated that Google had almost one million servers in [[data center]]s around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Server count&quot;/&gt; It processed over one billion search requests per day in 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;More than a billion searches&quot;/&gt; and about 20 [[petabyte]]s of data each day in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;20 PB of data each day 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;20 PB of data each day 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;20 PB of data each day 3&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- popularity --&gt;[[Alexa Internet|Alexa]], a company that monitors commercial web traffic, lists Google.com as the most visited website in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google most visited&quot;/&gt; Several other Google services also figure in the top 100 most visited websites, including [[YouTube]]&lt;ref name=&quot;YouTube most visited&quot;/&gt; and [[Blogger]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blogger most visited&quot;/&gt; Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world for 4 consecutive years,&lt;ref name=&quot;2013 Interbrand&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2014 Interbrand&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2015 Interbrand&quot;/&gt; and was valued in 2016 at $133 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016 Interbrand&quot;/&gt;

Google's [[mission statement]], from the outset, was &quot;to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,&quot; and its unofficial slogan was &quot;[[Don't be evil]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;corporate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/corporate/ |title=Google Corporate Information |website=Google, Inc. |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html |title=Google Code of Conduct |date=April 11, 2012 |website=Google, Inc. |accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html |title=Paul Buchheit on Gmail, AdSense and More |first=Philip|last=Lenssen |date=July 16, 2007 |website=Google Blogoscoped |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the motto was replaced in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: &quot;Do the right thing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digital Equipment Corporation (1957-1998) Motto - Do the right thing|url=http://aknextphase.com/do-the-right-thing/|accessdate=14 July 2016|website=aknextphase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Google's commitment to such robust idealism has been increasingly called into doubt due to a number of the firm's actions and behaviours which appear to contradict this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/25/evil-facebook-google-beheading-email-abuse|title=Who's more evil – Facebook or Google?|date=2013-10-25|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roxane |last=Gay |title=The Blog That Disappeared |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/opinion/sunday/the-blog-that-disappeared.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 29, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/ |title=The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web |last1=Page |first1=Lawrence |last2=Brin |first2=Sergey |last3=Motwani |first3=Rajeev |last4=Winograd |first4=Terry |date=November 11, 1999 |website=Stanford University |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called this new technology [[PageRank]]; it determined a website's [[Relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages, that linked back to the original site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html |title=Technology Overview |website=Google, Inc. |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-diglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/WP/get/SIDL-WP-1997-0072?1 |title=PageRank: Bringing Order to the Web |last=Page |first=Larry |website=Stanford Digital Library Project |date=August 18, 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020506051802/https:/// |archivedate=May 6, 2002 |accessdate=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first funding for Google was an August 1998 contribution of $100,000 from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], given before Google was incorporated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bechtolsheim&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/29/MNGLD6CFND34.DTL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919030812/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F2004%2F04%2F29%2FMNGLD6CFND34.DTL |archivedate=September 19, 2009 |title=For early Googlers, key word is $$$ |last=Kopytoff |first=Verne |date=April 29, 2004 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |publisher=Hearst Communications |accessdate=February 19, 2010 |location=San Francisco |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least three other [[angel investor]]s invested in 1998: [[Amazon.com]] founder [[Jeff Bezos]], Stanford University computer science professor [[David Cheriton]], and entrepreneur [[Ram Shriram]].

After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999,&lt;ref name=&quot;1998 Investments&quot;/&gt; a new, $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release|url=https://www.google.com/pressrel/pressrelease1.html|archiveurl=https://www.google.com/press/pressrel/pressrelease1.html |archivedate=March 9, 2000 |title=Google Receives $25&amp;nbsp;Million in Equity Funding |date=June 7, 1999 |location=Palo Alto, Calif. |publisher=Google |accessdate=February 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with major investors including the [[venture capital]] firms [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]] and [[Sequoia Capital]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bechtolsheim&quot; /&gt;

Early in 1999, Brin and Page decided they wanted to sell Google to [[Excite]]. They went to Excite CEO George Bell and offered to sell it to him for $1 million. He rejected the offer.

Google's [[initial public offering]] (IPO) took place five years later, on August 19, 2004.

In September 2015, Google engineering manager Rachel Potvin revealed details about Google's software code at an engineering conference. She revealed that the entire Google codebase, which spans every single service it develops, consists of over 2 billion lines of code. All that code is stored on a code repository available to all 25,000 Google engineers, and the code is regularly copied and updated on 10 Google data centers. To keep control, Potvin said Google has built its own &quot;version control system&quot;, called &quot;Piper&quot;, and that &quot;when you start a new project, you have a wealth of libraries already available to you. Almost everything has already been done.&quot; Engineers can make a single code change and deploy it on all services at the same time. The only major exceptions are that the PageRank search results algorithm is stored separately with only specific employee access, and the code for the Android operating system and the Google Chrome browser are also stored separately, as they don't run on the Internet. The &quot;Piper&quot; system spans 85 [[Terabyte|TB]] of data. Google engineers make 25,000 changes to the code each day, and on a weekly basis change approximately 15 million lines of code across 250,000 files. With that much code, automated bots have to help. Potvin reported, &quot;You need to make a concerted effort to maintain code health.

Google also stated that it does not count that as its final goal; it says that &quot;since the wind doesn’t blow 24 hours a day, we’ll also broaden our purchases to a variety of energy sources that can enable renewable power, every hour of every day&quot;. Additionally, the project will &quot;help support communities&quot; around the world, as the purchase commitments will &quot;result in infrastructure investments of more than $3.5 billion globally&quot;, and will &quot;generate tens of millions of dollars per year in revenue to local property owners, and tens of millions more to local and national governments in tax revenue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Urs |last=Hölzle |title=We’re set to reach 100% renewable energy — and it’s just the beginning |url=https://blog.google/topics/environment/100-percent-renewable-energy/ |work=The Keyword Google Blog |publisher=Google |date=December 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Google just notched a big victory in the fight against climate change |url=http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/6/13852004/google-data-center-oklahoma-renewable-energy-climate-change |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=December 6, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Google says it will hit 100% renewable energy by 2017 |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/google-says-it-will-hit-100-renewable-energy-by-2017/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=December 7, 2016 |accessdate=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492&amp;nbsp;billion in total advertising revenues and only $112&amp;nbsp;million in licensing and other revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;10-K&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312507044494/d10k.htm|title=Form 10-K&amp;nbsp;– Annual Report|accessdate=July 5, 2010|publisher=SEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google-Inc-Jan-2012-10-K&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/44/0001193125-12-025336.pdf |title=Google Inc, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Jan 26, 2012 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =March 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from the company [[DoubleClick]], to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nakashima, Ellen |title=Some Web Firms Say They Track Behavior Without Explicit Consent |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081102270_pf.html |date=August 12, 2008 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Miguel |last=Helft |title=Google to Offer Ads Based on Interests |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/technology/internet/11google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 11, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Analytics]] allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter |last=Bright |title=Surfing on the sly with IE8’s new “InPrivate” Internet |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/08/surfing-on-the-sly-ie8s-inprivate-internet/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=August 27, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google's [[AdWords]] allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through either a cost-per-click or cost-per-view scheme. The sister service, Google [[AdSense]], allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdSense&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/login/en_US/?sourceid=aso&amp;subid=uk-en-ha&amp;utm_medium=ha&amp;utm_term=adsense&amp;gsessionid=O---pJlnnf2wFZF8qu81Lg |title=AdSense |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of [[click fraud]], which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20&amp;nbsp;percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mills|first=Elinor|url=http://news.cnet.com/Google-to-offer-advertisers-click-fraud-stats/2100-1024_3-6098469.html|title=Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats|work=news.cnet.com|publisher=CNET|date=July 25, 2006|accessdate=July 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating &quot;Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130095413/http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban |archivedate=January 30, 2009|title= Google Somewhat Lifts Oceana Ad Ban|publisher=webpronews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was later changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/Terms.html|title= Google AdSense Online Standard Terms and Conditions |publisher=Google AdSense}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized because of [[Competition law|antitrust]] concerns by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/10/31/yahoo-and-google-may-dump-their-deal/print/ |title=Yahoo and Google may dump their deal|last= Mclntyre|first=Douglas |publisher=Bloggingstocks.com |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/ending-our-agreement-with-yahoo.html |title=Ending our agreement with Yahoo!|last= Drummond|first=David|date= November 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010|publisher=Google, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to advertise its own products, Google launched a website called Demo Slam, developed to demonstrate [[technology demonstration|technology demos]] of [[List of Google products|Google Products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demoslam.com/#/what |title=Google Demo Slam |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Google web search.png|thumb|left|250px|Google Search homepage as of September 1, 2015]]

According to market research published by [[comScore]] in November 2009, [[Google Search]] is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a [[market share]] of 65.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;comscore&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|date=December 16, 2006| title=comScore Releases November 2009 U.S. Search Engine Rankings|url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/12/comScore_Releases_November_2009_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google indexes billions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |title=Google's Misleading Blog Post: The Size Of The Web And The Size Of Their Index Are Very Different |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/googles-misleading-blog-post-on-the-size-of-the-web/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of web pages, so that users can search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and [[Operator (computer programming)|operators]].

In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained about Google's indexing, claiming that Google's [[web cache|caching]] of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-1024234.html |title=Google cache raises copyright concerns |last1=Olsen |first1=Stefanie |date=July 9, 2003 |work=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the United States District Court of [[Nevada]] ruled in favor of Google in ''[[Field v.

Google Watch has criticized Google's PageRank algorithms, saying that they discriminate against new websites and favor established sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/rights/14001/ |title=Conspiracy Researcher Says Google's No Good |author=Farhad Manjoo |date=August 30, 2002 |publisher=AlterNet |accessdate=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has also alleged that there are connections between Google and the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/14/Technology/Despite_popularly__Go.shtml|title=Despite popularly, Google under fire for privacy issues|newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|author=Dave Gussow|date=April 14, 2003|accessdate=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google also hosts [[Google Books]]. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books were allowed, into its new book search engine. The [[Authors Guild]], a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=China |last=Martin |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/google-hit-second-lawsuit-over-library-project-722 |title=Google hit with second lawsuit over Library project |publisher=[[InfoWorld]] |date=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Pettersson, Edvard|title=Google Wins Preliminary Approval of Online Books Settlement|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/67Qvo6uhf?url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3Dnewsarchive%26sid%3DahUxORgasDFs|archivedate=May 5, 2012|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=November 20, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière ([[Éditions du Seuil]]) from its database.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite news|author=Smith, Heather|title=Google's French Book Scanning Project Halted by Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/67QvoTecZ?url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid%3Dnewsarchive%26sid%3DapZ3UG9CPLo8 |archivedate=May 5, 2012|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In competition with [[Amazon.com]], Google sells digital versions of new books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Motoko |last=Rich |title=Preparing to Sell E-Books, Google Takes on Amazon |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/technology/internet/01google.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 21, 2010, in response to [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of [[thumbnail]]s that enlarge when pointed at. Though web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/this-week-in-search-72510.html |title=This Week in Search 7/25/10 |last1=Mayer |first1=Marissa |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=July 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;Hummingbird&quot; update to the Google search engine was announced in September 2013. The update was introduced over the month prior to the announcement and allows users ask the search engine a question in natural language rather than entering keywords into the search box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google introduces the biggest algorithm change in three years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/27/google-biggest-algorithm-change-hummingbird|accessdate=September 29, 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=September 27, 2013|author=Samuel Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, Google announced two major changes related to its mobile search results. The first, removing the &quot;mobile-friendly&quot; label that highlighted pages were easy to read on mobile from its mobile search results page. The second, on January 10, 2017, the company will start punishing mobile pages that show intrusive interstitials when a user first opens a page and they will rank lower in its search results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |title=Google will soon start punishing mobile sites that show hard-to-dismiss popups |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/23/good-riddance/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Google donated 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |title=Google donating 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to IMO |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2012, Google launched a &quot;[[Legalize Love]]&quot; campaign in support of [[gay rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/07/08/google-launches-legalise-love-gay-rights-campaign/|title=Google launches 'Legalise Love' gay rights campaign|work=PinkNews.co.uk|accessdate=September 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax avoidance===
Google uses various [[Tax avoidance|tax avoidance strategies]]. Out of the [[List of the largest information technology companies|five largest American technology companies]], it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. The company accomplishes this partly by licensing technology through [[Shell corporation|shell subsidiaries]] in [[tax haven]]s such as Ireland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metz|first=Cade|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/22/google_double_irish_tax_loophole/|title=Google slips $3.1bn through 'Double Irish' tax loophole.|publisher=The Register|date=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google's [[transfer pricing]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leach |first=Anna |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/10/31/google_france_tax_office_billion_euros/ |title=French gov 'plans to hand Google €1bn tax bill'&amp;nbsp;– report. |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following criticism of the amount of corporate taxes that Google paid in the United Kingdom, Chairman Eric Schmidt said, &quot;It's called capitalism. We are proudly capitalistic.&quot; During the same December 2012 interview, Schmidt &quot;confirmed that the company had no intention of paying more to the UK exchequer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Schmidt responded to questions about taxes paid in the UK by pointing to the advertising fees Google charged UK companies as a source of economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Arthur |first=Charles |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/22/google-eric-schmidt-tax-avoidance |title=Google chairman Eric Schmidt defends tax avoidance policies |publisher=The Guardian |date=April 22, 2013 |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Vice President [[Matt Brittin]] testified to the [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brid-Aine Parnell, May 17, 2013 |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/17/quotw_ending_may_17/ |title='I think you DO do evil, using smoke and mirrors to avoid tax'. |publisher=Theregister.co.uk |date=May 17, 2013 |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay £130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Gapper, January 23, 2016 |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d50ad5f4-c125-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2.html#axzz3y8YQABrf|title=Google strikes £130m back tax deal. |publisher=FT.com|accessdate=January 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
Since 2007, Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jack |last=McGrath |title=Google’s Green Initiative: Environmentally Conscious Technology |url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2011/05/18/googles-green-initiative-environmentally-conscious-technology/ |publisher=''TechnoBuffalo'' |date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it &quot;continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes&quot;, almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, most due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Glanz |title=Google Details, and Defends, Its Use of Electricity |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-and-defends-its-use-of-electricity.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2011 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Google launched a project centered on developing renewable energy, titled the &quot;Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE&lt;C)&quot; project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google’s Goal: Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal |url=http://googlepress.blogspot.no/2007/11/googles-goal-renewable-energy-cheaper_27.html |publisher=Google |date=November 27, 2007 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was cancelled in 2014, after engineers Ross Koningstein and David Fork understood, after years of study, that &quot;best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change&quot;, writing that they &quot;came to the conclusion that even if Google and others had led the way toward a wholesale adoption of renewable energy, that switch would not have resulted in significant reductions of carbon dioxide emissions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ross |last1=Koningstein |first2=David |last2=Fork |title=What It Would Really Take to Reverse Climate Change |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change |publisher=''IEEE Spectrum'' |date=November 18, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, ''The Washington Post'' reported that Google had donated $50,000 to the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[think tank]] that calls human carbon emissions a positive factor in the environment and argues that global warming is not a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anatomy of a Washington dinner: Who funds the Competitive Enterprise Institute?|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/20/anatomy-of-a-washington-dinner-who-funds-the-competitive-enterprise-institute/|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 20, 2013|author=Juliet Eilperin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, it was reported that Google had hosted a fundraising event for Oklahoma Senator [[Jim Inhofe]], who has called climate change a &quot;hoax&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Google hosts fundraiser for climate change denying US senator|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/09/google-climate-denier-jim-inhofe|accessdate=July 12, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=July 9, 2013|author=Suzanne Goldenberg|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Google cut ties with the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC) after pressure from the Sierra Club, major unions and Google's own scientists because of ALEC's stance on climate change and opposition to renewable energy.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{cite news|title=Google pulls out of conservative group amid environmentalist pressure|author=EVAN HALPER |date= September 23, 2014|work= Los Angeles Times |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-gop-20140924-story.html |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lobbying===
In 2013, Google ranked 5th in [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.&lt;ref name=lobby1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-google-is-transforming-power-and-politicsgoogle-once-disdainful-of-lobbying-now-a-master-of-washington-influence/2014/04/12/51648b92-b4d3-11e3-8cb6-284052554d74_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop|title=Google, once disdainful of lobbying, now a master of Washington influence|work=[[The Washington Post]] | first1=Tom|last1=Hamburger|first2=Matea|last2=Gold|date=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
{{main article|Google litigation}}
Google has been involved in a number of lawsuits including the [[High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation]] which resulted in Google being one of four companies to pay a $415 million settlement to employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosenblatt|first=Joel|title=Apple-Google $415 Million No-Poaching Accord Wins Approval|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-02/tech-no-poaching-settlement-gets-judge-s-preliminary-approval|accessdate=January 24, 2016|newspaper=BloombergBusiness|date=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversy==
{{main article|Criticism of Google|Censorship by Google}}
Google's market dominance has led to prominent media coverage, including [[Criticism of Google|criticism of the company]] over issues such as [[Google tax avoidance|aggressive tax avoidance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jesse |last=Drucker |title=Google 2.4% Rate Shows How $60 Billion Is Lost to Tax Loopholes |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-10-21/google-2-4-rate-shows-how-60-billion-u-s-revenue-lost-to-tax-loopholes |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=October 21, 2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criticism of Google#Page rank|search neutrality]], [[Criticism of Google#Copyright issues|copyright]], [[censorship by Google|censorship]] of search results and content, and [[Google privacy|privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6740075.stm |work=BBC News |title=Google ranked 'worst' on privacy |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeffrey |last=Rosen |title=Google’s Gatekeepers |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/magazine/30google-t.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticisms include alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of others' [[intellectual property]], concerns that its [[Data collection|compilation of data]] may violate people's [[Internet privacy|privacy]], and the [[energy consumption]] of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as [[monopoly]], [[restraint of trade]], [[anti-competitive practices]], and [[patent infringement]].

Google's [[Mission statement|stated mission]] &quot;to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/ Google Corporate Page], accessed October 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the means employed to accomplish it, have raised concerns among the company's critics. Much of the criticism pertains to issues that have not yet been addressed by [[cyber law]].

Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964 Edward Snowden: Leaks that exposed US spy programme]&quot;. BBC News. January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to leaks of said program, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = Glenn | last2 = MacAskill | first2 = Ewen | title = NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others | date = June 7, 2013 | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data }}&lt;/ref&gt;
