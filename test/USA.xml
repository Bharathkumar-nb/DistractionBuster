The short form &quot;United States&quot; is also standard. Other common forms are the &quot;U.S.&quot;, the &quot;USA&quot;, and &quot;America&quot;. Colloquial names are the &quot;U.S. of A.&quot; and, internationally, the &quot;States&quot;. &quot;[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]&quot;, a name popular in poetry and songs of the late 18th century, derives its origin from [[Christopher Columbus]]; it appears in the name &quot;[[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brokenshire1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Doug Brokenshire (Stanford University)|title=Washington State Place Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7XI52I8zI_AC&amp;pg=PA49|year=1996|publisher=Caxton Press|isbn=978-0-87004-562-2|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-English languages, the name is frequently the translation of either the &quot;United States&quot; or &quot;United States of America&quot;, and colloquially as &quot;America&quot;. In addition, an abbreviation (e.g. USA) is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the U.S. embassy in Spain calls itself the embassy of the &quot;Estados Unidos&quot;, literally the words &quot;states&quot; and &quot;united&quot;, and also uses the initials &quot;EE.UU.&quot;, the doubled letters implying plural use in Spanish [http://spanish.madrid.usembassy.gov/] Elsewhere on the site &quot;Estados Unidos de América&quot; is used [http://spanish.madrid.usembassy.gov/es/educacion/benjamin_2013.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase &quot;United States&quot; was originally plural, a description of a collection of independent states—e.g., &quot;the United States are&quot;—including in the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], ratified in 1865. The singular form—e.g., &quot;the United States is&quot;—became popular after the end of the American Civil War.

H. Emerson, ''The Universalist Quarterly and General Review'', Vol. 28 (Jan. 1891), p. 49, quoted in Zimmer paper above.&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans under the British explorer [[Captain James Cook]] arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778.

In the early days of colonization, many European settlers were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ripper2008|Ripper, 2008]] p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Natives taught many settlers where, when and how to cultivate corn, beans and squash.

After Spain sent [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] [[Columbus's first voyage|on his first voyage]] to the [[New World]] in 1492, other explorers followed. The Spanish set up small settlements in New Mexico and Florida. France had several small settlements along the [[Mississippi River]]. Successful [[English overseas possessions|English settlement]] on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and the [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims']] [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620. Early experiments in communal living failed until the introduction of private farm holdings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton|Walton, 2009]], pp. 29–31&lt;/ref&gt; Many settlers were [[English Dissenters|dissenting Christian groups]] who came seeking [[freedom of religion|religious freedom]]. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's [[House of Burgesses]] created in 1619, and the [[Mayflower Compact]], signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remini2–3&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Remini|2007|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson26–30&quot;&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Johnson|1997|pp=26–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most settlers in every colony were small farmers, but other industries developed within a few decades as varied as the settlements. [[Cash crops]] included tobacco, rice and wheat. Extraction industries grew up in furs, fishing and lumber. Manufacturers produced rum and ships, and by the late colonial period Americans were producing one-seventh of the world's iron supply.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton|Walton, 2009]], chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Cities eventually dotted the coast to support local economies and serve as trade hubs. English colonists were supplemented by waves of [[Scotch-Irish American|Scotch-Irish]] and other groups.

[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'': the [[Committee of Five]] presenting their draft to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in 1776]]

The American Revolutionary War was the first successful colonial war of independence against a European power. Americans had developed an ideology of &quot;[[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]&quot; asserting that government rested on the will of the people as expressed in their local legislatures. They demanded their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] and &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;. The British insisted on administering the empire through Parliament, and [[American Revolution|the conflict]] escalated into war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphrey2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Carol Sue |title=The Revolutionary Era: Primary Documents on Events from 1776 To 1800 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19NWMZ6Ec_sC&amp;pg=PA8 |year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing |isbn=978-0-313-32083-5|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the passage of the [[Lee Resolution]], on July 2, 1776, which was the actual vote for independence, the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on July 4, which proclaimed, in a long preamble, that humanity is created equal in their unalienable rights and that those rights were not being protected by Great Britain, and declared, in the words of the resolution, that the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were independent states and had no allegiance to the British crown in the United States. The fourth day of July is celebrated annually as [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]].

Indeed, World War II ushered in the zenith of U.S. power in what came to be called the [[American Century]], as {{Harvnb|Leffler|2010|p=67}}, indicates: &quot;Truman presided over the greatest military and economic power the world had ever known. War production had lifted the United States out of the Great Depression and had inaugurated an era of unimagined prosperity. Gross national product increased by 60 percent during the war, total earnings by 50 percent. Despite social unrest, labor agitation, racial conflict, and teenage vandalism, Americans had more discretionary income than ever before. Simultaneously, the U.S. government had built up the greatest war machine in human history. By the end of 1942, the United States was producing more arms than all the Axis states combined, and, in 1943, it made almost three times more armaments than did the Soviet Union. In 1945, the United States had two-thirds of the world's gold reserves, three-fourths of its invested capital, half of its shipping vessels, and half of its manufacturing capacity. Its GNP was three times that of the Soviet Union and more than five times that of Britain. It was also nearing completion of the atomic bomb, a technological and production feat of huge costs and proportions.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States played a leading role in the [[Bretton Woods Conference|Bretton Woods]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]] conferences with the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other Allies, which signed agreements on new international financial institutions and Europe's postwar reorganization. As an [[Victory in Europe Day|Allied victory was won in Europe]], a 1945 [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|international conference]] held in [[San Francisco]] produced the [[United Nations Charter]], which became active after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612221444/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2007 |title=The United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941&amp;nbsp;– October 1945 |date=October 2005 |accessdate=June 11, 2007 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, Office of the Historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States developed the [[Manhattan Project|first nuclear weapons]] and used them on Japan [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|in the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]; causing the Japanese to [[Surrender of Japan|surrender]] on September 2, ending World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2016/08/06/commentary/japan-surrender-world-war-ii/|title=Why did Japan surrender in World War II? {{!}} The Japan Times|newspaper=The Japan Times|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pacific War Research Society (2006).

They dominated the military affairs of [[Europe]], with the U.S. and its [[NATO]] allies on one side and the USSR and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies on the other. The U.S. [[Containment|developed a policy of containment]] towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in [[proxy war]]s and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.

The United States often opposed [[Third World]] movements that it viewed as Soviet-sponsored.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of its cues from Europe. Writers such as [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]] established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. [[Mark Twain]] and poet [[Walt Whitman]] were major figures in the century's second half; [[Emily Dickinson]], virtually unknown during her lifetime, is now recognized as an essential American poet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom|Bloom, Harold]]. 1999. ''Emily Dickinson''. Broomall, PA: Chelsea House. p. 9. ISBN 0-7910-5106-4.&lt;/ref&gt; A work seen as capturing fundamental aspects of the national experience and character—such as [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), Twain's ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1885), [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925) and [[Harper Lee]]'s ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' (1960)—may be dubbed the &quot;[[Great American Novel]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Buell, Lawrence|title=The Unkillable Dream of the Great American Novel: ''Moby-Dick'' as Test Case |date=Spring–Summer 2008|volume=20|issue=1–2|pages=132–155|doi=10.1093/alh/ajn005|journal=American Literary History |issn=0896-7148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelve U.S. citizens have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], most recently [[Bob Dylan]] in 2016.

The [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]], led by Thoreau and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], established the first major [[American philosophy|American philosophical movement]]. After the Civil War, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and then [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]] were leaders in the development of [[pragmatism]]. In the 20th century, the work of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] and [[Richard Rorty]], and later [[Noam Chomsky]], brought [[analytic philosophy]] to the fore of American philosophical academia. [[John Rawls]] and [[Robert Nozick]] led a revival of [[political philosophy]]. [[Cornel West]] and [[Judith Butler]] have led a continental tradition in American philosophical academia.

In the visual arts, the [[Hudson River School]] was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]]. The realist paintings of [[Thomas Eakins]] are now widely celebrated.

Major artistic movements such as the [[abstract expressionism]] of [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] and the [[pop art]] of [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] developed largely in the United States.

In the 20th century, the modern musical form emerged on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the songs of musical theater composers such as [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]] have become [[Traditional pop music|pop standards]].

Though little known at the time, [[Charles Ives]]'s work of the 1910s established him as the first major U.S. composer in the classical tradition, while experimentalists such as [[Henry Cowell]] and [[John Cage]] created a distinctive American approach to classical composition. [[Aaron Copland]] and [[George Gershwin]] developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music. [[Choreography|Choreographers]] [[Isadora Duncan]] and [[Martha Graham]] helped create [[modern dance]], while [[George Balanchine]] and [[Jerome Robbins]] were leaders in 20th-century ballet.

Director [[D. W.

[[File:ABC 77 W66 jeh.JPG|thumb|The corporate headquarters of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] in New York City]]
The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC), [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] (CBS), the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. The four major broadcast [[television network]]s are all commercial entities. [[Cable television in the United States|Cable television]] offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Streaming TV Services: What They Cost, What You Get|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/10/12/business/ap-us-streaming-tv-options.html?_r=0|accessdate=October 12, 2015|agency=NY Times; Associated Press|date=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans listen to radio programming, also largely commercial, on average just over two-and-a-half hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1004830 |title=TV Fans Spill into Web Sites |date=June 7, 2007|publisher=eMarketer |accessdate = June 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the number of U.S. commercial radio stations had grown to 4,793 AM stations and 5,662 FM stations. In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by [[NPR]] (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967; its television counterpart, [[PBS]], was also created by the same legislation. (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other.) {{As of|2014|09|30|df=US}}, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the US according to the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Waits | first = Jennifer | title = Number of U.S. Radio Stations on the Rise, Especially LPFM, according to New FCC Count | website = Radio Survivor | date = October 17, 2014 | accessdate = January 6, 2015 | url = http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/10/17/number-u-s-radio-stations-rise-especially-lpfm-according-latest-fcc-count/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known newspapers are ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] or [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]], which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have &quot;alternative weeklies&quot; to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's ''[[The Village Voice]]'' or Los Angeles' ''[[LA Weekly]]'', to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book]] began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, [[Superman]], the comic book [[superhero]] of [[DC Comics]], developed into an American icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Daniels | first=Les | authorlink=Les Daniels | year=1998 | title=Superman: The Complete History | page=11 | edition=1st | publisher=[[Titan Books]] | isbn=1-85286-988-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from [[web portal]]s and [[web search engine|search engines]], the most popular websites are [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[Wikipedia]], [[Yahoo.com]], [[eBay]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alexa-topsitesus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US |title=Top Sites in United States |year=2014 |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has been a leader in technological innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid 20th century. Methods for producing [[interchangeable parts]] were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories during the first half of the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a [[machine tool]] industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]]. Factory [[electrification]] in the early 20th century and introduction of the [[assembly line]] and other labor saving techniques created the system called [[mass production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] was awarded the first U.S. [[Invention of the telephone|patent for the telephone]].
